# The Divine Inheritance

## Mothra-Battra Relationship

- Mothra was *born* with the Divine Soul of the Heavenly Instance
- Mothra was aware of Battra's resentment toward her divine inheritance
- She helped him circumvent the Divine Covenant out of love
- “She wasn't blind to the way her twin looked at her sometimes--like she stole something from him. He thinks he could hide such things from her, but they forget they are twins--family. So, she agrees to this. If only because she loves her brother and wishes he ceases looking at her with resentment and envy in those ruby-colored eyes of his.”
