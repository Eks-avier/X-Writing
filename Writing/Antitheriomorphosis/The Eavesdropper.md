# The Eavesdropper

The Eavesdropper is a mystical concoction created by [[Battra, the Lord of the Mystic Arts|Battra]] for senior [[Monarch]] personnel. While ostensibly created to grant immunity to [[Keep Charlie]]'s intangibility failsafe, it serves a more covert purpose as a security measure ordered by [[Godzilla, the King of the Monsters|Godzilla]] and [[Mothra, the Queen of the Monsters|Mothra]].

## Properties

The concoction has three primary effects on its consumers:
- Grants immunity to Keep Charlie's intangibility defense system
- Makes the consumer vulnerable to [[Sorcery|sorcerous]] and [[Psionic|psionic]] influences
- Acts as a mystical beacon that Battra can track

## Purpose

### Official Purpose

The Eavesdropper is presented to senior Monarch personnel as a necessary component for accessing Keep Charlie's facilities, particularly as protection against its emergency defense systems. This allows them to maintain their presence within the Keep even when its intangibility failsafe is activated.

### True Purpose

Known only to Godzilla and Mothra, the Eavesdropper serves as an insurance policy against potential betrayal or compromise of senior Monarch staff. By making them:

- Trackable by Battra
- Vulnerable to supernatural influences
- The concoction effectively places them under supernatural surveillance

## Administration

The concoction is required to be consumed by all senior Monarch personnel who need regular access to Keep Charlie. Unlike students, who are automatically whitelisted in the Keep's security systems, Monarch staff must undergo this procedure to gain similar privileges.
