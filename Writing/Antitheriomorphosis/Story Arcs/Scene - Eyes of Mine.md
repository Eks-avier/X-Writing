Here are some details that may help you paint a picture of Dagon:
- Icy blue eyes 
- Dark gray scales
- Snow white dorsal fins 
- He's a bit wider than Godzilla in his Titan form
- He had mentioned hating looking at his son, not unkindly though—it reminds Dagon of Godzilla's mother. 
- But Dagon was a bit of a hypocrite, never missing a moment to admire his son. 
- "What a horrible liar," Maria woud say. "Like father, like son."

Here's some details that might help you paint a picture of Godzilla's mother:
- The same beautiful golden eyes
- The same obsidian scale coloration 
- The same dark dorsal fin coloration 
- Thinner, smaller than her mate

Thus, Godzilla was a mix of both their features: 
- He bore his father's visage and build—though slightly thinner and taller than him.
- He had his father's dorsal fin shape.
- He had his mother's eyes.
- He had his mother's obsidian scale coloration.
- He had his mother's dorsal fin coloration.

Godzilla was merely in an egg when his mother had died. He had never seen her, never felt her touch, just rumbles and some noises that could be either hers or his father's. When he finally hatched from his egg, only his father was there to greet him.

He was smaller than expected and seemed to have a weak constitution, likely had something to do with his mother. But such things don't really matter to the Titanus gojira. Other species might discard their offspring for being born weak, but their species is different. Thanks to their bottomless well of potential, such birth defects were merely set backs. After all, Godzilla now is the strongest being on Earth—a prime example of that principle. 

Yet even so, Dagon simply had trouble admitting just how much he loved his son. In his little child, he saw his dead mate and himself—the proof that their bond was real. Maybe there was hope in there too, that in his son their people will rise once more, even if he looked a little small for his age. One of many of Dagon's regrets was that he never said he was proud of his son enough.

Godzilla would eventually convince himself that these were signs point to his father's inevitable abandonment.

What he didn't know was that Dagon was proud, that no matter what happens to him, his son will bear his parentage. That fact that he was his son was enough for him to proud. He just wished he had more time to tell him that.

I would like to add that Godzilla regretted hating his father so much (is that in the source files?), that he thought his own sire abandoned him. Perhaps that's what makes the memories of him so painful.

We can juxtapose this with Maria and Bartholomew. It's not entirely the same, but perhaps this can be one of the hints of the twins' reconciliation. 

Another addition is Godric's willingness to have blue eyes now. Normally, when he's not using his power it'll be gold—his true color. However, since he remains always on guard and alert, it's always blue.

He always hated it before, secretly. Whenever his eyes are blue and he looks at himself in the mirror—it almost looks like his father looking at him. Eons ago, the mere sight would send him in a sour and pained mood.

Yet now, even after learning the truth, it still remains painful. But anger no longer swells in him, just grief and regret. Now he finds himself wondering... if he had black hair because of his dark dorsal fin coloration thanks to his mother, would his father have white hair due to his snow white ones? Godric still finds it too painful to look at his reflection. 

Not even his own mother's eyes could save him from such sorrow. He was happy to have them, happy to at least have something different from his father in visage. Now, he sometimes imagines a vague, faceless apparition of her, the only feature he knows would he the eyes he himself carried. Yet even in the facelessness of his mother—she would look ashamed. She would look at his own son betrayed; his own son who cursed his own father and her mate for eons.

He finds that he can't stand looking at himself at all anymore—gold or blue eyes.

When he dons his blue eyes, he imagines his father looking at him through the features he gave his son. What was once a source of anger, now a source of grief and sorrow.

When he dons his gold eyes, he imagines his faceless mother, looking at him with betrayal and disappointment in the same eyes he held. 

Imagining them in that way is utterly unbearable. He'll fight Ghidorah a thousand times than that. He'll search and destory the Xillien colony in the galaxy himself than suffer that. He'll gratefully be bisected and shredded by Battra's Twin Cutters a million times than see that.

If only his heart healed as fast and as effortless as his unblemished, unmarked body. Cuts, holes, missing limbs... all within seconds they will heal. Why not this wound then?
