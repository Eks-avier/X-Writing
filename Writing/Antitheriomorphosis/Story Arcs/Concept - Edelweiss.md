# Concept - Edelweiss

The night air is warm.
Not heavy, not oppressive—just warm.
The kind of warmth that clings gently, like an old memory, like a dream that hasn't faded yet.

The sky stretches wide above them, a deep indigo canvas scattered with stars.
The waves of Infant Island lap softly against the shore, whispering to the sand.
The world is quiet.

And then, he hums.

Not a roar.
Not a rumble.
Not a growl or a warning or the deep, heavy silence of the king of monsters.

Just—
A hum.

---

He hadn't expected to enjoy the act.

Humans and their songs, their music.
He is not ignorant of them.

He has heard them before.

He heard them in the days of Atlantis.

He heard them in prayers and hymns sung to the sea.

He heard them when humans mourned their dead.

He heard them when they sang to each other in love.

He heard them sing to him.

They have always sung to him.

But he had never thought to sing back.
Not until Mothra.

Not until she dragged him into those ridiculous musicals.

Not until Battra's students looked up at him, unafraid, and told him—
“You're good at this.”

Not until one of them whispered,
“Your voice is deep and strong… yet gentle.”

Not until the words of a human song slipped from his mouth without thinking.

---

A memory returns

He saw this song once.
A human film—The Sound of Music.

The students made him watch it.
He barely paid attention.
But then—
A melody.
A quiet, fragile thing.

It reminded him of something.

His father.
His people.
His home.

The North, where the winds howled across the ice.
The stories his father told him beneath the stars, when the world was small and simple.

And so now, alone beneath the stars, he sings it.

---

His voice is low and steady, carrying the weight of something old.

Godzilla (softly):
“Edelweiss, Edelweiss…”
“Every morning you greet me…”

The song drifts across the air, curling into the night.

And then—
He hears movement behind him.

A presence he would never mistake.

He doesn't turn.

He doesn't need to.

Because Mothra is already stepping forward, already joining him.

---

She was watching the stars, lost in thought, when she heard him.

Not speaking.
Not commanding.
Not giving orders.

Singing.

It stops her in her tracks.

She doesn't interrupt.
She doesn't announce herself.
She just—listens.

There is something unspoken in his voice.
Something deep, buried, but still there.

Something that reminds her of him.

And without thinking—
She sings too.

---

She steps beside him, her voice light as the wind.

Mothra (softly):
“Small and white, clean and bright…”
“You look happy to meet me…”

Their voices blend.

She doesn't know why it makes her chest ache.

Godzilla glances at her, gold eyes flickering in the starlight.
She doesn't look away.

Together:
“Blossom of snow, may you bloom and grow…”
“Bloom and grow forever…”

The words feel too big.
Too heavy.
Too real.

And yet—
Neither of them stop.

---

Their voices fade into the night.

The waves continue their quiet song.
The island breathes.

Neither of them move.
Neither of them speak.

Godzilla looks up, watching the stars.

Mothra looks at him.

She doesn't know why her throat feels tight.

She doesn't know why she suddenly feels fragile.

And then, he murmurs, barely above a whisper—

“That was… nice.”

A pause.

A breath too long.

She exhales.

“Yes.”

Her voice is too soft.

The silence stretches between them, unspoken things filling the space.
She almost—
Almost—
Reaches for his hand.

But she doesn't.
And he doesn't either.

Instead—
They just stand there.

Two drifters, caught between past and future.
Between what was and what could be.

And under the starlit sky of Infant Island, they say nothing more.

Because some songs are not just songs.
Some moments are not just moments.

And some things?
Are felt, not spoken.

---

The night is warm, but the warmth does not reach him.
Not fully.

Not the way it should.

The stars above seem dimmer than he remembers.
They shift, they flicker, they disappear from clusters he once knew.

They were never the same as when he was a hatchling, curled beside his father.
Never the same as when he looked up into icy blue eyes, waiting for the world to fade into sleep.

Godzilla hums, softly.

Not to her.
Not to anyone.
Not even to himself.

But to the North.

To the winds.
To the ice.
To the frozen kingdom he once belonged to—
To a homeland that no longer exists.

“Bless my homeland forever,” he sings again, quieter this time, so soft as if whispering a prayer.

He wonders—
Would his father have had a song like this?

Would they have sung of the North?
Would they have sung of the sea ice and frozen cliffs, of the blizzards and the deep, endless winters?

Would it have been something like—
“Bless the North”?

He scoffs.
Such a silly thought.

But as with all thoughts of his father, it does not stay light for long.

---

The moment creeps up on him before he can stop it.

A young thought.
A childish thought.
A thought he buried deep when his father never returned.

“I wish you were still here.”

It escapes his lips before he can stop it.
It claws its way out of the pit he threw it in his psyche.

And suddenly, he is not here.
Not on Infant Island.
Not in this time, not in this body, not in this world.

He is small again.

A hatchling, curled beside warmth.
A son, watching his father watch the stars.

He stares at the sky and counts the stars, the ones that have disappeared, the ones that have drifted apart.

They are never the same.

Not like when he was young.

---

She says nothing.

She doesn't have to.

She just watches—
The way his golden eyes dim.
The way the fire in them fizzles into a low flame.

She has spent 250 million years watching his eyes.
She knows how they shift with the tides of his thoughts.

She has always watched them.
Because she cannot read his face, not fully.

Lizards—Titans—monsters—they do not show grief the way humans do.

But she knows that look.
She has seen it too many times.

The way he stares into the horizon.
The way he stares into the blanket of stars draping over the night.

He is mourning.

And she doesn't understand it.
She hates that she doesn't understand it.

She may mourn for her people.
She may mourn for her parents.

But never to the extent that he does.
Never to the weight that lingers in his eyes, heavy and endless.

And for the first time in a long time—
She wishes she could take that pain away.

She wishes she could reach inside his chest and return him to the bright gold she loves so much.

(Oh. That thought is laid bare.)

Her breath catches.

She does not move.

And still, he says nothing.

Instead, he stares at the sky—
And he wonders.

---

“If he survived—”
“Would we both sing?”

The answer comes immediately.
Without hesitation.

Heaven, no.

His father would have hated musicals.
Would have grumbled endlessly about being forced to sing.

The thought is so absurd that—
He laughs.

And Mothra blinks.

She tilts her head.

“What?”

He shakes his head, smiling, his chest lighter now.

“Nothing. I just thought—”

“He would have hated it.”

She raises a brow.
“Hated what?”

“Being forced to sing in a musical.”

She stares for a second—then, without warning—laughs.

A small sound at first, delicate as the breeze—
And then something brighter, something warmer.

It spreads.

Suddenly, he is laughing, too.

Not much.
Not loud.
But just enough.

And for the first time that night, the weight in his chest feels bearable.

---

Mothra exhales, still smiling slightly.

The stars shine overhead, unchanged, eternal.

Godzilla hums one last note of the song.

And then—
Softly, absently, as if carried by the wind—

“You look happy to meet me.”

He sings it.
As if continuing “Edelweiss.”
As if it belongs here, in this moment.

And she laughs again—not because it's funny, but because it's true.

She does.

She has.

For longer than she has ever admitted.

They sit in silence.

And for the first time in a long time, Godzilla lets himself wonder.

Maybe in another time, in another world—
His father would have sung with him.

Maybe it would have just been the two of them.
Under the same sky,
Ages ago,
A different song, a different life.

But always—
Always, the same stars.
