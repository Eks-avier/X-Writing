# Plot Outline - Dagon Resurrection Arc

## Timeline Placement

**Setting:** Late 2026 (Post-Domestic Fantasy)
- Approximately 6-8 months after Godric and Maria's relationship formalization
- During the “peace era” but introducing significant disruption
- After Arthur has unknowingly become host to Ichi
- Before the Nebulan emergence but setting groundwork for it

## Core Narrative Approach

After careful consideration of the narrative options, a hybrid approach offers the most compelling storytelling opportunities:

- **Initial resurrection is ephemeral** (Option 2) - Creating powerful emotional closure
- **Leading to permanent but transformed existence** (Option 1) - Allowing for ongoing narrative presence

This structure provides both the emotional catharsis of a father-son reunion while allowing Dagon to become an important ongoing character with unique insight into the Antitheriomorphosis process.
