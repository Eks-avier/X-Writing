# First Phase

## News — Battra

- Early in the morning Monarch receives confirmation of the existence of a titan breeding facility located somewhere deep in the USA countryside. 
- With the cooperation of the local government, Monarch manages uncover the facility's coordinates, along with other incriminating evidence about the facility itself.
	- A decade ago, this would have already been toppled by Godzilla. His hulking form, leaving ruins ignited by the power of the atom. But due to the Antitheriomorphosis[^1], he had to get used to his human body and human customs. Thus, for a year or two after that, it was Monarch who handled it.
		- Eventually, Godzilla acquired mastery over his human body, even becoming well acquainted with the human perspective; yet still, he identifies as a titan.
		- Adjusting his immense power proved to be a challenge, but over the course of 3 years, he had successfully gotten a good grip on his abilities, even discovering several new applications. 
		- As soon as Godzilla could comfortably function as a human, he wasted no time in resuming his tenure as King of the Monsters—the one who keeps Titans in order.
		- However, for the past year and a half, Godzilla has delegated some of his responsibilities back to Monarch, and only the higher-ups are privy to the King's reason. 
			- Rumours say that the King is located in a rural state in the USA, but none can say for certain.
	- Mothra, who is their supposed second option is confirmed to be accompanying Godzilla. Unfortunately, the Queen has long since expressed, even way back in ancient times, that she is utterly disinterested in filling Godzilla's place as balancer among the titans. Most find her behavior odd, as she is recognized by the titans as the co-Alpha, yet she prefers to oversee human affairs. 
		- This due to an ancient vow between King and Queen.
			- Godzilla is *free* to exert his authority over *all* titan species, including Mothra, as is his right as the Alpha; Mothra cannot object to his decisions when it comes to Titan affairs. 
			- In return, Mothra may *freely* object to Godzilla's decisions *if* humanity is concerned; Godzilla *cannot* use his authority over her to *deny* her pleas and objections nor can he even *ignore* them. 
			- An additional clause has been added in 2020, a year after King Ghidorah's defeat.
				- Neither *cannot* do anything *for* or *against* humans without *both* consenting to it.
		- Mothra does however still appear at Castle Bravo from time to time, but she doesn't answer anything concerning her and Godzilla's current affairs. She just delivers baked goods she made herself. 
		- Sometimes she'll bring plastic containers filled with cooked meat. Everyone thinks she cooks that because it tastes good, but in reality it's Godzilla who does it; nobody knows he can cook.
	- Battra is supposedly the third option, but is technically the second. He currently resides in Castle Bravo, Monarchs's current headquarters and premier mobile fortress roaming in the Pacific. 
		- Battra would normally defer to the Betas of Godzilla and Mothra, Anguirus and Rodan respectively, making him the fifth option; but with the King and Queen both preoccupied, the Beta duo are left to oversee Monarch's operations in the Hollow Earth, accompanying King Kong who reigns over it.
		- With the 4 people up in the hierarchy preoccupied, Battra uses this opportunity to train his students, assigning them live missions that aim to expose them to real-world scenarios. 
- Upon being notified and informed by Head Director Mark, Battra is struck with an idea that he hopes is equal parts educational and entertaining, at least for him. 
- As soon as Mark finished informing him, Battra promptly leaves central command. He glides by the Wall Walk, the Portcullis Mystic looms above him.
	- On his way, he conjures three objects in the cutely shape of a file. They glow, though dimly, and appear as if they are holograms. 
		- Battra thinks about the latest news brought to him by Mark. There have been several across the couple weeks; incidents and rumours here and there, Battra tries to piece together at least 2 more live missions. 
		- Battra finds himself giddy, oh one of his lovely students are in for a ride. 
		- Then, after passing Portcullis Mystic, he formulates the other two missions.
		- Both of Battra's temples illuminate, glowing tendrils emerge and find the three objects encircling him, filling them with all the necessary information needed for a live mission. He finds this method superior over making a bunch of PowerPoint slides; being both a sorceror and a psychic has its benefits.
- An entire section of the Castle Bravo is dedicated for Battra and his students. 
	- The section, termed as Keep Charlie, is divided into many facilities, each tailored for a different group of students. 
		- Battra was the progenitor of human sorcery, teaching many mystics from ages long past. Now, with the recent resurgence of sorcerers, he resumes his tenure as a teacher.
		- Battra is also a natural psychic (Mothra's species have always been psychic); and inspire of the fact that Mothra is *the* superior psychic, making *her* the strongest psionic entity on Earth, she admits she is not as good a teacher as her twin. 
			- Most things come intuitively to Mothra since she *is* the actual Divine Moth[^2], having inherited the soul of a Divine Instance from their father. Her boundless talent is the source of Battra's envy; she is the golden child between them. Every spiteful thing Battra does to her is rooted in this fact.
	- This entire wing of the Castle Bravo exists in an extended mystical space conjured by Battra. 
		- The Wall Walk, which was also made by Battra, serves as the bridge and anchor to the mobile headquarters. 
		- Students, however, do not live in Keep Charlie. They live in one of the many residence areas located in Castle Bravo itself. 
			- Th student residence area remains distinct from those of the scientists and military personnel by being a lot less bleaker and practical in atmosphere. It's also decorated by both “departments” of Battra's “school”.
			- The student residence is also divided in two, one for the Sorcery Department, which is accessible via a student-made portal, and the other for the ESP Department, whose lounge has an automatic mind-linking machine that enables and facilitates instant communication with the students.
		- 5 facilities for developing sorcery are available for 8 young sorcerers and sorceresses-in-training. 
		- 3 facilities are available for 10 young men and women gifted with ESP abilities.
		- 2 special facilities are available and made suitable for 3 little kids—2 of which possess aptitude for both sorcery and ESP, and 1 who seems to be a prodigal psychic.
		- 2 homerooms are provided for the older students and a playroom for the younger ones.
		- A lounge where both departments can hang out is provided.

## Announcement — Johns

- It was late into the noon when suddenly Battra phases through the wall of his ESP students' homeroom. The students aren't surprised by the gag, having been used to their teacher's random eccentric entrances. This one is tame compared to his previous ones.
- The room was adorned with a winter-themed attire. Some snowmen lined the shelves, while little lights illuminated the corners of the ceiling. The bulletin board was white and themed with green trees and colorful garlands. A 6 foot Christmas tree with cards, baubles, action figures, and candy attatched was posted at the corner of the room. 
	- Battra was a little amazed when his students insisted that they decorate the room. For a bunch of boys and girls aged 18-21, they seem to take something as silly as classroom decoration seriously. However, they've lived most of their lives in a cold, dark and damp underground facility; dehumanized and turned into mere experiments and tooks. It is doubtless that they would a normal school life.
- His students were sat at their tables, bored looks plastered on their faces. Battra chuckled, they should've been out and about roaming cities, shopping, playing games and whatever but they're here instead. Well, allowances don't earn themselves, they have no choice nor say in the matter if they wanna splurge out. 
	- Internally Battra muses the alternative scenario that this meeting was just for making some announcements. His students might try a coup on him. Amused, he could already imagine their reactions; a shame this had to be a serious matter.
- Battra informs them of 3 live missions. They weren't too difficult; they were either covert or retrieval missions, after all. At his announcement, the students' interests were piqued.
- One of them, Suki, asked Battra how their split will go. 
- Battra swiftly presents them with a 5, 4, 1 split. He gestures and a cutesy hologram-like visual of 3 groups about to be matched with 3 missions manifested.
- Gerome is alarmed that 1 of them will undergo a solo mission. The others murmur in agreement, while others saw it as either a challenge or a horrible decision. 
	- Gerome Marcel offers himself to go solo. He's great at covert missions and has the most combat experience among his family. 
	- Suki Takao counters and offers herself. She's the current strongest telepath and telekinetic in the class . There's no one better who can spare the others from the solo mission. 
		- Gerome chides her and says that pure power is isn't always anything. Suki doesn't relent and insists that she goes solo, pointing out that Gerome's far more valuable as a coordinator.
	- The rest object to the idea of a solo mission itself and suggest a more even split.
- Battra, internally amused, silences them, the mystical visual to his side mimicking his action. The assignments have already been set, much to the chagrin of the students. 
	- He clarifies that the solo mission will be accompanied by military personnel. How many and who? Battra hasn't decided yet, but that announcement seemed to do the trick as some of the students were now alarmed and slightly anxious.
	- Battra has been drilling into them to practice with regular humans. He knows that most of them lack the experience with it, especially since creating mind links with non-telepaths require twice the effort. They need to be prepared when they aren't grouped among themselves. One of them has to set an example.
- Samuel Johns is a young man, 20, with auburn hair. He was lankier than most of the boys in class; the third lankiest to be precise. He can run fairly fast but that's all he has to his name. Battra has already scolded him and two other boys for it, pointing them to the gigantic in-house gymnasium at Castle Bravo. But he just feels unmotivated; he is undeniably great at mind linking and has been praised as being quick in his feet—he prefers to focus on improving on what he's already good at. 
	- Upon hearing the existence of the solo mission, he just prayed to God it couldn't be him. He's most comfortable with his classmates, who have effectively become his family since they've been together for 2 decades now. He's open to working with either of the class' powerhouses.
- But luck would soon not be on Johns' side as Battra reveals the names of the students assigned per mission.
- Battra enlarges the visual. Each of the student names morphed into a respective chibi version. 
	- Suki Takao was assigned to the first mission; another girl and 2 boys were to be under her leadership. They need to bust an illegal operation in the outskirts of Mexico. An addictive substance was being smuggled not into the USA and then distributed to the entire world. The substance is said to be created from refined titan feces, particularly that of Behemoth the current guardian of the Amazon. They need to figure out how that is even possible and to retrieve at least a sample; if it came down to it, they are allowed to neutralize anyone who would harm them. After a few disgusted remarks, the students settled down and their chibi-selves waddle towards their assigned mission. Suki is pleased at the mission ahead.
	- Gerome Marcel was assigned to the second mission, a retrieval op in Europe, particularly in rural England. Monarch has detected a titan there, likely held against its will. Their team of 5, composed of 2 boys, including Gerome, and 3 girls are to identify, locate and retrieve it. Their team is the biggest as they may neither be sure if this titan is passive or aggressive nor if there are dangerous people protecting it. Better to be safe than sorry. Their chibi-selves toddle towards the assigned mission. Gerome, though cool as usual, is internally excited to go to England.
	- However, the other youth bicker. Some in Gerome's team bemoan that a power-type like Suki gets a bust op, a perfect fit for her skills, while some in Suki's team were either more comfortable with retrieval missions and wanted to see the missing titan or want to visit England itself. 
	- But all their bickering slowly diminished as each realized that the one with the solo mission… was Johns. 
		- Sam was flitting over his notebook, his light brown eyes scanning notes for maths. Battra said they have a calculus quiz after winter break and he wants to get ahead. 
		- Suddenly, his classmate Kane taps his shoulder and points him to the visual in front.
- The young man's normally serene eyes turn into wide saucers as he watches his chibi-self skip cutely, as if oblivious to his doom, towards the third mission. 
- He frantically turns around, his family all giving him sympathetic stares. 
- Nathan was the first to Sam's defense, offering his spot on Gerome's team for Sam. Others followed suit, and not long chaos filled the homeroom.
- Battra simply shuts it all down. He minimizes the visual and it spirals into a thin string of light, shooting through the room by phasing through the walls and finding its mark in the central computer located at the central command of Castle Bravo. 
- He says nothing more beyond a smile and snaps himself out of existence. In his place was a note. The students clamor to read what it is, but Suki levitates it above them and towards her. 
- She relays the note to everyone via telepathy. All of them will leave by tomorrow evening so prepare at the soonest. For Johns, he will meet his partner by dawn. 
- The students deflate and head to the living quarters outside of the Keep Charlie, some eager to prepare early and some to ruminate. Others note that the letter mentioned a singular partner, meaning Johns may only be in a duo—horrifying said young man even more.
- Walking through the Wall Walk, the students offer Johns sympathy and some even want to help him prepare for tomorrow. 
- Sam was terrified. He felt as anxious as the day of their escape. Hopefully though, it won't be that bad.

## Reflections — Johns

- The student residence of Castle Bravo was built to be a lot friendlier and warmer, as opposed to the darker, muter tone reserved for the science and military personnel. 
- The late afternoon atmosphere entwined with the salty air of the ocean to generate a meditative mood in Johns' quarters.
	- One of the greatest benefits of living in Castle Bravo was the view just outside his window. The wide expansive sea and sky stretching towards the horizon. If it hadn't been for animals like birds and critters invading his room, he might have had it open all the time instead.
- Sam sat at the edge of his bed, wavy auburn hair brushing against his eyes. He silently considers a haircut soon. Despite liking his current look, it's been starting to distract him. 
- Sam sighs, annoyed he doesn't even know what to pack. With his classmates, they can afford to goof off and bring a random assortment of items, but now he's not so sure.
	- Will the mission go long enough to require a fresh set of clothes? 
	- Does he need to pack anything for his marine partner?
	- Which little trinket should he bring with him for luck? 
- All he's done for the past fortnight was to sleep, study, meditate, and admire the scenery from the hangar with his classmates and scientist friends. 
	- He remembers when the renowned psychic Miki Saegusa visited the base. The first psychic and the only human to have ever linked minds with the King of the Monsters. Sam remembered all 10 of them being so excited and fired up. 
		- Miss Saegusa was only 3 years older than Gerome, their eldest; and like them, she suffered being a sentient tool for megalomaniacs and heartless scientists looking to exploit her gifts. And much like them, she was saved by Godzilla.
		- The sorcery students were left agape by the mess the ESP students were creating. Sam doesn't believe that both student groups have bad blood, as Battra would have nipped all of that at the bud immediately, but they do hold some rivalry till this day. The rivalry was especially fiery between Suki Takao and Andrew Julius Ford—the current top sorceror-student. He remembers the teases they get, constantly being paired up with each other, but that just seemed to piss both of them; and as much as both student divisions find it entertaining, no one wants to face the wrath of their respective class' powerhouses.
- Sam slumps back and flops on his soft bed. Everyone at Monarch treats them well, the titans also do.
	- Godzilla helped saved them. He could never forget the tall, imposing man clad in black collapsing the entire facility in an effort to reveal their location. He distinctly remembers the man's golden eyes full of… something. No one really knew what the King of the Monsters thought and felt. Perhaps Ms. Saegusa does, or maybe Mothra, but he doubts even they do.
	- Mothra nursed them all back, acting as the mother they never had. Until today she visits them, urging all, including the sorcery division, to share any problems, offering her help wherever needed. She makes a mean steak apparently and when asked how she does it, she simply waves it away and giggles.
	- Battra was their mentor and teacher. Goofy as he is, he loves them and they love him. He recalls both divisions even helping him prank his twin sister, no questions asked. And without him, they wouldn't even know what they could be capable of now. He's a good teacher, even if his methods are a little unorthodox, which is fair as he is managing a bunch of young sorcerers and psychics.
	- The rest of the titans were either impartial or cordial. Mothra said it's better to keep their distance as not all titans are comfortable with human presence. Though, that doesn't mean those titans hated them. 
	- Monarch gave them a home, and that alone is enough for them to be motivated, at least for Sam. He's never had his own room, his own gadgets, a huge hangar hangout, and more. This life was all an abused boy stuck in darkness and hooked up to countless machines a lifetime ago wanted.
- Why is he so scared and worried then? He's in good hands… Sam feels an immense urge to scream. The mission hasn't even started and he's already so exhausted.
- A lesson from Battra about mental fortitude sprang from his subconscious, who is perhaps eager to move him from his stupor. Sam sighs, and continue rummaging his closet to find something, anything to pack.
- Before Sam could continue though, a knock on his door rang through his room.
- He told them to enter and in came all 9 of his classmates. 
- They all take him in like a whirlpool, offering him useful advice and words of assurance and motivation. 
- A burning fire ignites within Sam. What was he thinking? He has his family, he needs to do this for them.

## Midnight Stroll — Johns

- At midnight, Sam found that he couldn't sleep. He's only got about four to six hours of sleep left. Yet, even with the extra assurances he got from his family and other personnel who joined them during dinner, he still felt a pit of anxiety in his stomach. It consumed him, forcibly keeping him awake.
- He tried doing everything, from trying different positions, breathing techniques, counting sheep, and the like. Still, nothing worked. He tried meditating, and to no avail he couldn't. He was too distracted, too bothered.
- Johns did what he shouldn't do and got up. He shot a glance at the windows beside him. Had it not been the light from Castle Bravo, the ocean would be nothing but pitch black abyss. He didn't care.
- Wearing nothing but his night clothes, he made a silent beeline to the hangar. He regretted the decision immediately as the night breeze felt like freezing winds. He could have at least brought a cloak, jacket, coat, or the like. 
- Alas, he's relegated to shivering on the hangar. He muses that he probably needs this. 
- The hangar was well lit, contrasting the abyss below them. Usually there should still be activity, Castle Bravo doesn't really sleep after all. But it seems the hangar is free for tonight. 
- Sam senses some people still awake all throughout the facility, some were on their night shifts and others were in their quarters or labs studying. None, however, were on the hangar so he should be safe from prying eyes. 
- All of Battra's students, whether from the sorcery or ESP division have been tutored in expert pranking, likely in an effort to use them against Mothra. As such, Sam knew where all surveillance cameras were on Castle Bravo by heart. 
	- They may be able to convince people they don't exist in their heads, but it's harder to fool a machine.
- Sam gracefully sneaks around, avoiding as much CCTV cameras with grace and practiced ease.
- Sam settles on an empty space, devoid of any aircraft or equipment. This is one of the spots where people can hang out in hangar, hence the Hanger-Out. No one knew who gave that stupid name, but it eventually caught on.
	- Not too long ago, it was made official and became a place where people can congregate besides the cafeteria. Some chairs, snacks and drinks from the cafeteria were regularly delivered, allowing people to feel the ocean breeze and enjoy the excellent scenery.
- Finding a mono-block, Sam sits and savors the cool midnight breeze. He stares into the abyss below. People his age would normally be horrified by the absolute lack of light below him, but Sam lived in an underground facility for nearly 2 decades of his life. His classmates—family were the only people he knew. As edgy as it sounds, he was born in darkness. For now, he settles in peace, finally entering a meditative state. 
- Johns didn't know how long he stayed there, but he figured he had enough. The annoying pit in his stomach has disappeared and he'd rather not freeze to death outside. 
- Manoeuvering through the equipment scattered orderly around him, Sam found himself near the entryway to the student residences. 
- However, he detects presence. He halts just before the entryway. Though his eyes couldn't see, his mind does. 
- Battra forbids them from reading thoughts without consent, citing his twin sister who finds it rude and unethical. However, surface thoughts are fair game, it's just like reading body language after all; Sam's reach stops just before this person. This one's a man.
- Psychic projection was an advanced skill, but Johns was one of 6 who can do it, and one of 3 who can do it from a distance. Only Gerome can fully project across great distances, that's what makes him so good at covert missions. Still, his skills aren't shabby and he spots the man leaning on the hangar's railings.
- Sam was lucky as the light of the hangar reached this area. The man he's spying on had ash-blonde hair cut short. He was wide and tall and wore nothing but a white shirt and some pants. His head was partly into the darkness so Sam couldn't make out any more details.
- Sam positioned his projected self closer to the man. He notices the shadow of hair on the man's jaw, which moved animatedly as Sam finds out that he was talking to someone on the phone. 
- Frankly, Sam thinks this man is attractive. Maybe the girls might make a better judge than he is, but it's simply an objective fact.
- However, the man suddenly paused and looked around him. Upon finding nothing, he continues talking into his phone. 
- Sam had already fled and sneaked as gracefully as he could towards his room. 
- Upon reaching his room, he checks his phone. It was 2 AM, crap.
- He flopped on his bed, bouncing slightly and found it now easier to close his eyes. In a couple of minutes, Sam was out cold.

## Late — Takao

- Sam was awoken by a couple of slaps on his face. 
- Groggily, he opens his eyes to his horror: a floating red air horn aimed straight at his face.
- Sam yelps and jumps out of his bed, only to bump into someone. The collision sent both young men in pain.
- Suki dispels her telekinetic hold on the air horn; it dropped on the bed, and Nathan clutched his nose. The former was dismayed she didn't get to use the air horn.
- Sam after having recovered realized the two were trying to wake him up. He grabbed his phone by the lamp beside him and finally felt his eyes open wide to the time: 5:30 AM
- Cursing, Sam shot through both of his classmates and went straight to his bathroom.
- The other two couldn't even get another word in, concerned looks on their faces. 
- Suki informs him that he's supposed to have waken up 30 minutes ago. Battra, from what they've seen, doesn't seem too pleased, but that's probably because or that Mothra visited last night. Suki wasn't sure, she only caught a glimpse of it from a worker's surface thoughts. What was said between the twins or what they did, that's where Suki's knowledge about it ended.
- Nathan then picked up after Suki, saying, all while playing with the air horn the latter discarded on the bed, that a man on a hangar at midnight felt that someone was watching him. He asked Sam, showering and frantically having soap bottles get thrown off their places, if he knew anything about it. 
- Sam could only keep cursing. What was he thinking staying up so late?! And God forbid anyone knew what he was doing at midnight.
	- Battra's current mood was an interesting point though, their teacher either is as nonchalant as a capybara (as one of his classmates said) or as eccentric to the point of looking like a clown. Nevertheless, he doesn't want to add to his master's seemingly unstable mood.
	- Also curious was how he hadn't sensed the Queen that night. Either she came earlier or she hid her presence somehow, though, that's probably telling of the gap in power and skill between her and the rest of them. 
- Suki grabbed Nathan and told him that they will wait outside just before Sam exits. She informs the young man in the bathroom that they'll be by the lounging quarters. 

---

- On the way to the ESP lounge area, Suki talks to Nathan mentally. She brings up how uncharacteristic it is for Sam to be late like this. Normally, he's one of the more punctual among them—only Gerome is more punctual. 
- Nathan draw ups a blank on Suki's assessment. Sam's surface thoughts were overtaken by panic, so there's nothing he could glean from his classmate. 
	- The “never read others' minds without consent” extends to them, even though they spent most of their youth connected to each other; each of them were sensitive to each other's thoughts and feelings.
	- Mothra simply says that they all deserve a little privacy from each other, especially as they grow. Plus, it's far more stimulating to not rely on their abilities when it comes to reading people.
- The living room, normally filled with snacks, drinks, the gaming console of the day, and the like, were now a land of bags, equipment, and other preparations they need for the mission; Julia Simmons always remarks that it looked more like an airport before every mission.
- The rest of their classmates were double checking, triple checking their stuff and some were lazily chit-chatting, none of them too eager to prepare this early—except for Gerome who's sipping tea and reading up on England and other information that Battra had given him. He has all of his belongings neatly packed and prepared on a corner. 
	- One of them asks if it's too early to prepare, but Marcel chastises them, saying that it's better to prepare now and figure out which needs to be with them and which needs to be left behind, rather than cooking up a panicked frenzy late into the afternoon. He looks pointedly at Kane, who once forgot a potion he requested from the sorcery division that mutes their movement—it was for a stealth mission.
	- One of them asks if Sam's awake already. Suki and Nathan arrive, the latter hearing the question and giving his classmate a thumbs-up. 
- As if expecting the two's arrival, both assistant directors, Drs. Chen popped over from the corner of the lounge entrance. They were here a couple of minutes ago, but the twin doctors inquired them again if Sam is already there—his partner's waiting for him.
- Suki, mentally, told them that Sam would be there any minute now. 
- A frantic dashing Sam with bags on his shoulders and already looking exhausted from carrying them appeared from one of the lounge entrances connecting to the student residence.

---

- As the twin head directors walk alongside Sam on the Wall Walk, they initiate mental conversation.
- Sam welcomed the presence in their mind, letting it calm his nerves. They served as substitute teachers for the students whenever Battra's out for whatever reason.
- One of them, Ling, asks what happened for him to be so late. The other, Ilene, offers her hand to hold.
- Sam decided on whether to share everything, but seeing as they're already in his head, he might as well. So Sam tells them that he had trouble sleeping last night and went for a midnight stroll by the Hanger-Out. He left out on seeing that mysterious man though, burying it deep within his mind, away from his surface thoughts.
- Ling tells Sam it's okay to be worried. While Monarch and Battra try their best to select missions that wouldn't put any of them in fatal positions. 
	- They remind Sam to recall the weight if the responsibility he has—both of the students division's responsibility. 
		- They're part of the world of titans now, and so as long as they take an interest in them, that'll never change. Their fates are entwined with the titans.
- Sam steels himself, memories of the people who gave him and his family a life worth living for flashing in his mind. He won't fail the people who did everything for them; the least Sam could do is repay the people who saved their lives.
- Ilene squeezes his hand as they arrive at Central Command. This is where debriefings happen; where Monarch's brain is. Behind these doors, they have saved the world a countless times. There was always a feeling of levity whenever he passes through these doors with his family, but now that he's alone an inescapable chill creeps up from behind his neck.
- Sam senses the presence of his master inside. He seemed his usual nonchalant self, which Sam should find comforting, but echoes of Battra's unstable mood dance in his mind.

## Introductions — Johns

- The doors of the facility open abruptly, sliding out of their way with a snappiness that betrayed their massive size. 
- Standing out from the crowd, his black and purple robed master was levitating cross-legged and talking to the only other resident titan: Methuselah. 
	- Methuselah was said to be the oldest of the titans, older than Godzilla, Mothra, and Battra. 
	- Though Methuselah despises combat and possesses a patient demeanor, he's not afraid to defend himself if provoked.
	- The ancient titan opted to serve as Monarch's sole janitorial service, finding the Hollow Earth boring and unstimulating. 
	- Methuselah's abilities allow him to grow and control flora with the addition of emitting an aura that stimulates rapid growth of fauna. He is the secret to Castle Bravo's incredible livability, as well as cleanliness due to being capable of efficient and waste-free trash disposal. 
		- Methuselah enjoys his current job and Monarch enjoys not having to spend a portion of their budget to cleaning and maintaining the hulking mobile fortress.
- As soon as the doors revealed Sam, the titan-sorceror glided towards him. Battra doesn't seem to be in a sour mood, contrary to what Suki told him a while ago; perhaps whatever stupor his teacher found himself in has subsided.
- Sam expected a harsh rebuke, but all he got were his master's crimson eyes piercing him. Battra promptly returned to his position at the center of the area. 
- Methuselah waved at him and excused himself from Battra, ambling on to clean things around central command. 
- Sam reluctantly stepped forward. In his mind, he really didn't want to enter, but he let his body keep walking towards his master.
- Once Sam was a few centimetres from Battra, the latter held a hand to halt his student from walking forward any further and removed something. To any outsider, Battra looks like a children's magician in a birthday, miming at air, but what he removed was an invisibility cloak that revealed a man underneath.
- Sam felt like he could pass out any moment now. Has he done something wrong these past weeks? What did he do to deserve this torment? Because, before him stands a scowling man that is supposed to be his partner. The man on the hanger that he was snooping on.
- Battra caught on to the young man's fluster and embarrassment. He spared no moment to tease the young man. 
- After a moment of teasing and jabs that left Sam as red as a tomato Methuselah can grow, Battra introduced the man 
	- First Lieutenant Blaine Richmond Carter, 25, stood before this lanky boy—he is unimpressed. The moment he was informed of a mission while he was in Texas, he was quick to have done some research on the ESP students living here at Castle Bravo. Suffice it to say, they're a bit of an unnerving bunch, unique from the other division he was acquainted with.
	- Carter expected someone like Gerome or Suki, but was thoroughly surprised when he learned from his superior that Samuel Johns was to be his partner.
	- It was ridiculous to him. This kid likely couldn't even carry half of his body weight and Monarch expects this boy to come with him and dismantle an illegal breeding ground. Both of them will *dismantle* an illegal breeding facility. *Just the both of them*. Either he's the unluckiest soldier ever, or this was punishment of some kind.
- Sam could not be mistaken in recognizing this man. Though he did notice that the shadow of a beard on his jaw was gone—shaved. He also noticed that he's bigger in person, likely beyond six feet or something compared to his measly 5 foot 8. 
	- The soldier was lean yet from last night, Sam knows the man's uniform is definitely hiding a muscular frame. The realization dawns on Sam, hitting him like that telekinetic push Suki did in training, why is he acting like an ogling girl in high school? He wished he could contact Ford right this very moment to concoct a intangibility or invisibility potion, he needs to disappear—pronto.
- Battra could practically have the crescent moon on his face from how wide he's smiling. This *will* be fun. He hasn't even gotten to the better part of the mission: he's tagging along as Sam's supervisor. 
- Sam weakly asks his master if they're being deployed now, mentally at first, only to find that Battra's mind is blocked, likely intentionally, flustering Sam even more. He tries then to physically talk to his master, only to find the words in his mouth to not be as loud as he'd like. 
- Battra tells his student to speak up, the giddiness evident on his face. 
- Sam does as he's told, only to be met with a quick reply by Carter: they won't be leaving till later evening, just like his other classmates.
- Battra continues that they will be sent to their deployment vehicles via portals created by the sorcery students. It's their equivalent of a project or exam, and Battra spirals into a hysterical rant about how proud he is of his students creating portals while a vehicle is moving. Sam wonders why his master couldn't find something like that for his ESP students, he finds a bit of short-lived levity by jokingly wondering if Battra prefers his sorcery division more. 
	- Sam glances to his supposed partner to find his angled ash-blonde brows furrow, exasperated by Battra's antics.
- Finally, Battra gives the rest of the information in the form of a folder conjured from thin air, unnerving Blaine with the act. 
- Sam catches the folder when it's flung at him with telekinetic force. 
- The marine waits for his copy, but Battra simply snaps out of thin air, but not before reappearing and giving Methuselah a little trinket, which the latter appreciates. The sorcerer disappears immediately after.
	- Methuselah uses the trinket to create a little portal into the scientists' residence area. 
- Sam meekly says not to bother with his master, he does that all the time. 
- Sam wonders why he has become so soft-spoken right now. What's wrong with him? But before he spirals out of control mentally, he tells Carter that they'd probably be sharing this folder.
- Upon opening it, a note written in fancy script says that 'sharing is caring' and to 'acquaint yourself with your partner'. 
- Sam sighs, wishing all this would end now. He'll take two calculus quizzes and two history quizzes back to back over this. 

## Awkward — Carter

- As the morning sun finally rose, Sam found himself tailing behind the soldier. He's well aware that he looks like a puppy, but he's starting to not care. Sam just wants to understand why the hell's he feeling this way. 
- Blaine finds both of them a spot at Hanger-Out. The hangar came alive with the buzzing of workers, some were getting drinks and eating breakfast, and some were discussing plans for today 
- There's an island there with snacks and drinks of all kinds, the soldier chooses to grab a drink Sam doesn't know. 
- Sam himself chooses some crackers and toast prepared by the cooks who came up from the main kitchen.
- The two sat in front of each other, salty ocean wind billowing around them. The buzzing of the workers around them began to increase as more and more people went out; soon Castle Bravo would be at its busiest.
- Blaine has only ever been in Castle Bravo thrice. One when he was introduced to it, one during the invasion of the Xilliens 7 years ago, and another one after that whole debacle. He stayed for 4 months before moving on. 
	- It's been 6 years since he'd been here; everything feels so new and so foreign now. He doesn't recognize this place anymore.
		- Apparently the supernatural students live in a place called Keep Charlie. He saw the out of place medieval wall walk on the way to Central Command. 
			- He mused how stupid of a name the sub facility had. Castle Bravo had weight, Keep Charlie sounded childish.
			- Had he not met his young friends at the sorcery division, he probably wouldn't even know Keep Charlie existed. He thought it had been just like 6 years ago, where the students, who were only 3 in number that time, stayed in the residential area for scientists.
				- Now they have their own residential area, their own facilities, and a bigger class.
	- He recalls that, surprisingly, he came out relatively uninjured during the invasion, a couple gashes and bruises littered his torso, arms, and back, leaving sone scars behind.
	- A couple of days after the war, he was offered some kind of potion by the kids studying to be sorcerers and sorceresses. 
		- Upon taking it, his scars healed, all of his tattoos faded away, his hair grew back in some places and he suddenly felt like a decade younger (despite just being 25 years old—in the prime of his life). 
			- He recalled a boy named Andrew muttering that they may have gone a *bit* overboard with the effects and said they could find a way to reverse some of it.
				- If they were talking about his ink, he didn't really care. He's frankly just grateful he feels a little more alive and vigorous.
	- Some of his mates refused the potion and liked the reminder of the war, but honestly he took it because he wanted to serve longer.
	- Now, a couple of years later, he's finally acquainted with the other half of the supernatural wing of this impossibly colossal facility. 
- Sam was quiet as ever, munching on his crackers and adding some toppings every now and then. He tried focusing on the peanut butter, the syrup, the fruits instead of Blaine. The latter, though, wondered if the kid was this quiet because he's used to talking via his mind.
- Carter told Sam to look at him, and Sam did as he was told, like a little puppy—he cringed. It pissed Sam off, but at the same time he liked it, a voice deep in his mind wanted more of that from the soldier. 
- The soldier told him that neither of them are gonna go off on a good foot if they just keep quiet the whole day until their mission.
- Sam quietly wished it *would* be like that; in and out, over and done. 
- Blaine proposed an alternative to him, saying that if he really doesn't want this, then he can just call the whole thing off. He can bring in his mates and they'll take this one over. As gently as his gruffness can allow, he tells the young man that there's no shame in doing so. 
- Sam replied if he really did believe that. He's a marine wasn't he? Would he really turn down a mission because he felt wrong about it?
- Carter smiled, noting that the boy's quick in his feet, which is good. He simply shook his head in reply. 
- Sam then continued, saying that he's just a bit overwhelmed. He'll get over it later. 
- Blaine asks how long that will take, because if he can't get over it quickly, it can jeopardize the mission. 
- Sam said nothing more because he doesn't know what to say. He's still figuring out why his words come out so softly; why he feels his face heat up; a million “why”s flooding his mind. He wished Suki or Gerone was over, maybe they can tell him.
- As if the Heavens themselves were listening, he felt the presence of Suki walking towards Hanger-Out. With her was Gerome reading something in his phone, sipping on some juice while walking, and Kane holding a tub of rocky road flavoured ice cream. 
- The soldier called out to the latter. Wasn't it a bit too early for ice cream?
- Kane shook his head. It's never too late or early for ice cream. 
- Suki initiated the introductions. Shaking the man's firm, rough, and calloused hand, she can't help but deny that the man is *hot*; but, she's here for his classmate turned little brother. Something's bothering him and it's bothering the rest of them all the way from the lounge as well, which is why they're here; Sam probably forgot that there are telepaths who can feel his distress in this very facility. 
- After it was Gerome's turn to give the soldier a solid handshake, he excused the auburn haired young man. He continued for Suki, as in sync as telepaths oft are, telling Carter they want to talk about something with him.
- Kane slipped the tub of Rocky Road in his armpits and dragged the distressed young adult away. Kane noted that Sam felt lighter than usual, he could probably drag his friend on his shoulder if he weren't holding his tub. 
- Suki says they'll be back later, and Carter replies he'll be around Hanger-Out or in his quarters. He began to tell them where, but Suki already got the info by skimming the marine's surface thoughts, creeping the man out slightly.
- Gerome smiled and waved farewell.
-  The four began walking toward the entry way leading to the ESP students' lounge.

## Confrontations — Marcel

- Once they reached the couches, Kane settled Sam down. The former settled down on a love seat beside the couch and continued wrecking the tub of rocky road flavour ice cream. 
- Beside Kane, a TV remote floated up. With a little bit of eyebrow gestures, the young man made the TV light up, revealing a paused anime. Telekinetically, Kane pressed resume on the remote.
- The two top-notchers of their class and Sam looked on incredulously. Kane simply asked why they're looking at him like that. Since he's not gonna be able to watch during a mission anyway, he might as well binge.
	- Gerome reminded him if he packed everything they need. Suki told Kane that she's leaving him in Mexico if he forgot something. 
	- Eager to get the heat off him, Kane answered none of their inquiries and asked Sam if he's okay.
	- Both Suki and Gerome simply groaned as one in annoyance. 
- But without missing a bit, Suki pointed at Sam abruptly, telling him to get his shit together.
- Sam *already* knows that and he's getting really really frustrated. He doesn't *understand* why he's feeling what he's feeling so how can he even begin to get his shit together.
- Gerome suggests that if he doesn't share what's bothering him, Sam's gonna explode, mentally that is.
- Sam looks at him crazy, they know the solo mission's eating away st him, what else is he supposed to share?
- But as if the man was reading his mind, which he likely was, Gerome told Sam that that's not *all* he's feeling.
- Suki agreed. Kneeling down to Sam's level on the couch, she urged him to share it. 
- As Sam was refusing to look up at them, she went on ahead. You like Mr. Carter, don't you? Lightly, she whispered to Gerome what the soldier's rank was as she didn't want to appear too casual about the gruff man. Was he a lieutenant or something?
- Sam sprang up and said it suddenly with the full power of his voice. His partner was first lieutenant. Embarassed again, he sat down and slumped further and further into the super soft couch Monarch graciously provided them. 
- Sam asked what he looks like to his classmates in front of him.
	- Gerome says he looks like a tomato grown from Methuselah's greenhouse in Castle Bravo.
	- Suki tells him he reminds her of Rodan's magma plumes, taken from when he was still in a titan form.
	- Kane simply says he can stand-in as Rudolph the red nosed reindeer.
- Sam then goes on to explain, it's not that he likes likes the man. 
	- Kane scoffs at the “I don't like like him” part but gets whacked by a PS5 controller telekinetically controlled by Suki.
- Sam continues to say that he was the one who was watching him in the hangar at midnight. And before Kane says anything dumb, Sam then adds that it was just a chance encounter—he didn't expect the soldier to appear.
- The three look at Sam intently, Kane only for a little while as he was preoccupied watching and eating. 
- Sam the goes on to explain everything he did before 2 AM in the morning.

---

- His three classmates promise to never tell anyone about his secret midnight escapade, but Gerome warns that if he doesn't get a grip on his emotions everyone will end up knowing what he's thinking and feeling anyway.
- Gerome then goes on to remind him one of their master's advices, emotions are a telepath's greatest ally AND enemy. 
- Suki goes on to remark that someone like Gerome would totally take all that to heart. The latter just rolled his eyes. 
- Leaving Kane behind to enjoy, the three friends walk back to Hanger-Out. Only to find a curious scene.
- One of their classmates, Julia, was showing off her telekinesis to the seated marine, while Nathan was talking about something. It seems like the soldier was listening, but none of them are sure.
- Sam smiled at that, they're trying to support him. 
- Before Sam called out to his partner, Suki did first. She waved at the gruff man and their classmates. The latter eagerly returned the greeting. 
- Sam still felt a touch of anxiety, but he did indeed feel better after their talk a couple of minutes ago.
- It was only 8 AM, but it felt like a day has passed to Sam. He wonders if he can survive until evening and the mission. 

## A Start — Johns

- A couple minutes later, their classmates left and retreated back toward the lounge. 
	- Gerome wanted to visit the labs for something and the rest were curious enough to follow. Sam could only catch some whispers, mentioning a collaboration with the sorcery division.
	- Suki went off into the section of Castle Bravo where most military personnel congregate.
		- She teased Sam mentally, and said that maybe she should check out some of the guys there too. 
		- Recalling Suki's remark about his soldier partner being hot, Sam became flustered once again.
		- Suki then continued that maybe she should nab Blaine for herself. Remarking that tey sound like a good fit, to which Sam only becomes redder and redder.
	- Suki then said that if she's lucky she can secure herself a date after all their missions have passed. Although who wouldn't fall for her anyway.
	- Despite the fluster Sam held remarkably well, attempting to keep his cool as much as he could. Suddenly, with renewed confidence, he shot back, saying that he didn't expect Suki to be so eager to have a boyfriend. 
	- The young woman simply said that she was inspired by Sam. Soon after, she was off. 
	- Gerome called out to her, asking Suki if she wants to come with, but she declined and strutted off to where she said she wanted to go.
- Soon, it was just the both of them. The buzzing of his friends died down, only the ambience of the ocean and the other workers outside remaining.
- Carter started first, asking the young man before him if he got all of his issues out of his system. 
- Sam chuckled lightly and nodded. 
- The two fell into a more comfortable conversation, learning a bit about each other.
	- Blaine Carter told him that he was from Texas and that he's got a little sister, way younger than even Sam is. 
		- Intrigued, Sam brings up the youngest among them, a psychic-sorcerer James. The little boy was 7 years old. 
			- Blaine finds himself smiling and replies that his younger sister was 6. 
	- Samuel Johns replied that once upon a time, he and the other students—including James, served as giant lab rats who were locked deep within an underground facility. It had earned him a gaze that could ressemble concern from the gruff man . 
		- Sam wanted to give more information about his and his family's past. He withheld himself.
	- Sam mentally noted how in spite of the older man's vigor, angled features, and newly shaved jaw, his gruff face still makes him appear older than he does. Maybe the soldier should smile more. 
		- Oh, Sam's doing the weird thing again. Embarrassing, but he pushes on. Also, he asks the soldier if he's a cowboy too, laughingly.
			- Carter said he might be one. His family did own a ranch. 
	- Another silence befell again, but it was less suffocating this time—an improvement Blaine remarked to himself.
	- The soldier noticed Sam staring again, but paid him no mind. Sam was probably waiting for him to talk more, so Blaine regaled the young man of some his thrilling missions and his mates. Johns listened intently to all of them. Sam thought it was nice to see life from a non-telepath's side without having to read it directly in their minds. 
	- In return, Sam told him some of his friends and their various specialties and skills. While none of them really paid it mind, there was some sort of social and academic hierarchy among them. Like, Suki had the best telepathy and telekinesis and she was good at combat too; Gerome was an expert at psychic projection, perception manipulation, memory extraction AND he has the best combat skills; Julia was an empath and a telekinetic; Nathan was good at using his psychic abilities for persuasion; Kane was their resident multi-tasker, and more. Sam noticed that while the marine's face seemed to be not indicating any interest, there was a lightness in his sky blue eyes that belied it.
		- Sam wanted to see those eyes light up again.
- For the first time since the announcement at the homeroom yesterday, Sam was finally getting a semblance of normalcy again.
