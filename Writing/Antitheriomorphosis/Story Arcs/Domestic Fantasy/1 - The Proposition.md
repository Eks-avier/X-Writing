# Domestic Fantasy

## Chapter 1: The Proposition

Golden sunlight filtered through the massive reinforced windows of Castle Bravo's eastern hangar. The mobile fortress drifted lazily across the Pacific, its shadow casting patterns across the ocean surface below. In the area known as “Hanger-Out,” Godzilla lounged with his back against a shipping container, eyes closed, soaking in the morning rays.

He hadn't moved in three hours. He didn't need to.

“So you're just going to bail on me?” Kong's voice crackled through the phone pressed against Godzilla's ear. “After I went through all the trouble of setting this up?”

Godzilla sighed, keeping his eyes closed. “You didn't 'set up' anything. Humans organize these tournaments without your involvement.”

“Yeah, but I got us the tickets! Front row! Do you know how hard that was?”

“You used Monarch funds.”

“That's not the point,” Kong insisted. “The point is, this is the heavyweight championship! Silva versus Thompson! It's going to be historic!”

Godzilla opened one eye, glancing around the hangar. Several of Battra's ESP students were scattered about, pretending to eat lunch or study. Every single one of them was eavesdropping—their attention patterns obvious to his enhanced senses despite their attempts at casualness. The youngest, a girl no more than eighteen, had completely forgotten to chew the sandwich in her mouth as she listened.

“I'm busy,” Godzilla stated flatly.

“Busy?” Kong's laugh boomed through the phone. “Doing what? You've been lying in the same spot for days! Methuselah thinks you're part of the floor now. He tried to grow moss on you yesterday.”

The corner of Godzilla's mouth twitched slightly. The students quickly looked away, suddenly fascinated by their textbooks.

“It's my hibernation cycle.”

“Your what now?”

“Hibernation. Sleep. I'm supposed to be entering a ten-thousand-year rest period.”

There was a pause on the line. “Ten thousand years? That's a bit excessive, don't you think? I mean, I like naps too, but—”

“It's not a nap,” Godzilla growled, with less bite than he would've liked. “It's a biological necessity for my species.”

“But you're not—I mean, you don't have—” Kong stumbled over the words. Even after years of the Antitheriomorphosis, they all struggled to reconcile their Titan identities with their human forms. “Look, you're telling me you seriously plan to sleep for ten thousand years? Where would you even do that? In your little Monarch-issue bedroom?”

Godzilla considered the question to his ruse. He hadn't actually thought through the logistics. As a Titan, he would simply find a radiation pocket deep in the ocean and let the currents lull him into the long sleep. As a human…

“I haven't decided,” he admitted.

“Well, decide to come to the fight instead! Saturday night. I'll even buy the snacks this time. With my own money,” Kong added quickly.

The King of Monsters had spent weeks in this state of semi-hibernation. No territory disputes required his intervention. No rampaging Titans needed subjugation. The calm should have been welcome.

“Don't you have a kingdom to rule?”

“Yes, but—”

“Focus on *that* then—territory disputes over there get out of hand faster than you can swing your damn axe.”

Kong simply huffed, his powerful exhalation fogging up his device's camera. “Wanna bet, G-Man?”

*Like a petulant child,* Godzilla thought. He could *almost* feel an upward tug at his lips.

With a slight groan, he concedes, “I'll think about it.”

“That's Titan-speak for *no*,” Kong grumbled. “Fine. Rodan already said he'd come. At least someone around here appreciates good entertainment.”

The call ended, and Godzilla slipped the phone into his pocket. He was aware of the students' poorly disguised interest. One boy whispered to another, “Did he just say ten thousand years?”

“Mr. G planning a nap is the most relatable thing ever,” another student replied. “Wish I could sleep for ten thousand years.”

“You practically did during yesterday's training session,” a girl retorted, earning snickers from the group.

Godzilla pretended not to hear, though internally, he found their lack of discretion almost amusing. Humans—even psychically gifted ones—could be remarkably obvious.

“Sir?”

He opened one blue eye again. A young woman—one of Battra's more promising ESP students—stood nervously a few feet away. Unlike the others, she approached directly, maintaining eye contact though he could sense her heart racing.

“Dr. Russell asked me to find you,” she said. “Briefing in ten minutes. Central command.”

He didn't respond, merely closed his eye again. He lets his memory work—ah, this one's Julia Simmons. The student—Julia—apparently understanding that this constituted acknowledgment, backed away quietly.

The others immediately leaned in her direction, whispering questions. “What did he say? Is he going? What's the briefing about?”

Godzilla sighed. Mark Russell was an adequate leader for Monarch, especially considering the man had once tried to kill him. Their relationship had evolved into something resembling mutual respect, though Russell still flinched whenever Godzilla moved too quickly. Understandable. Human memory was both remarkably sharp and incredibly dull.

With reluctance, he rose from his resting place and stretched, joints cracking with sounds like distant thunder. The students fell silent as one, watching with wide eyes as he rolled his shoulders, the motion rippling through his frame.

“Ten minutes means you've got eight left,” he rumbled as he passed the group. “But sure, waste it staring.”

He heard them scrambling to look busy as he walked away, their panicked movements bringing the faintest smile to his lips.

The thuds of his boots was the only sound as he walked through Castle Bravo's corridors. The facility's personnel had learned to listen for it—the sudden cessation of conversation, the instinctive shuffling against walls—that marked his passage.

The briefing room's sealed doors slid open automatically, security protocols recognizing his unique energy signature. Inside, Mark Russell stood at a holographic display, engaged in quiet conversation with Mothra.

She looked up as he entered, her lips curving into a subtle smile. Even in human form, she radiated warmth—platinum blonde hair falling in waves, bright blue eyes lighting up at his arrival. The familiarity of her presence, after countless millennia of friendship, should have been comforting.

Instead, it made something in his chest tighten uncomfortably.

“You're late,” Mark said without turning.

“I'm here,” Godzilla countered, his deep voice reverberating through the room despite its softness. He took position at the edge of the tactical table, deliberately standing rather than sitting.

Mark manipulated the holographic display, bringing up satellite imagery of a small town surrounded by fields and forests. “We've got a problem. Ghidorah fragments.”

Godzilla's attention sharpened immediately. Even the name of the three-headed usurper was enough to trigger a cascade of combat responses in his nervous system. “Where?”

“One fragment detected in this rural town, Meadowvale. Population just under five thousand.” Mark expanded the display, revealing a picturesque main street lined with small businesses. “We suspect the piece was smuggled through black market channels before ending up here. Could be someone doesn't even know what they have.”

“Why not simply retrieve it?” Godzilla asked, already calculating how quickly he could reach the location.

“Because we don't know exactly where in town it is,” Mark explained, his frustration evident. “Our equipment can detect Ghidorah's unique radiation signature from orbit, but localization requires closer proximity. And unfortunately—”

“The signature is weak,” Mothra interjected, her voice melodic even when discussing scientific matters. “Too weak for precise targeting. And we can't exactly evacuate an entire town on a hunch.”

Mark nodded. “We need a ground operation. Subtle. Long-term if necessary.”

“I can find it myself,” Godzilla stated flatly.

“By doing what, exactly?” Mark challenged. “Showing up and demanding everyone empty their pockets? This needs finesse.”

“Finesse,” Godzilla repeated, the word like gravel in his mouth. “You're talking about the creature that nearly destroyed this planet. Twice.”

“Which is precisely why we can't afford mistakes,” Mark countered. “One wrong move, and whoever has the fragment might hide it or worse—unwittingly activate it.”

Mothra stepped forward, her movements fluid and graceful. “I have a suggestion.” She manipulated the display, bringing up floor plans for a modest two-story house. “We establish a presence in the community. Two Monarch operatives living as ordinary citizens, conducting the search methodically without raising suspicion.”

“And you're volunteering,” Godzilla observed, already sensing where this was headed.

“We are,” Mothra corrected, meeting his gaze steadily. “You and I.”

The room fell silent. Even Mark seemed to be holding his breath.

“No,” Godzilla said simply, turning to leave.

“It would be the most effective approach,” Mark called after him. “Two Titans working together, both able to sense Ghidorah's energy signature. You'd be operating as a married couple—the Nordsons. New teachers at the local school.”

Godzilla paused at the door, his back to them. “Find someone else.”

“There is no one else,” Mothra said quietly. “You know what Ghidorah is capable of. Even a fragment contains corruption potential. If it awakens—if it could contaminate a human host—”

“I know what Ghidorah does,” he interrupted, memories of Boston flashing through his mind.

“Then you understand why it needs to be both of us,” she pressed. “We both have the highest capability to sense and neutralize it.

The unspoken message was received. She means to say his *new* developments from his fight with Battra namely his expanded senses and energy disrupting or even nullifying abilities.

“And why must we pretend to be married?” he questioned, turning back with narrowed eyes. “Why not colleagues? Neighbors? Cousins?”

“Married couples have reasons to be together constantly,” Mark explained. “They can communicate privately without suspicion. They can cover more ground as a unit. And frankly, it's the easiest cover to maintain in a small town where everyone knows everyone's business.”

Godzilla's eyes flicked to Mothra. “This was your idea.”

She didn't deny it. “It's the logical approach.”

“How long?” he asked, reluctantly circling back to the tactical table.

“As long as it takes,” Mark answered. “Could be days. Could be months.”

“Months,” Godzilla repeated flatly.

“Would you rather sleep for ten thousand years?” Mark asked, a hint of challenge in his voice—though a hint of mirth was noticeable to anyone who knew Mark much. “Because that's the alternative if Ghidorah reconstitutes. Permanent hibernation. For everyone.”

Mothra approached him, stopping close enough that he could see the subtle shifts in her iris—movements invisible to human perception. “You can't possibly be serious about lounging here all day,” she said, her voice pitched low for his hearing alone. “This is Ghidorah. Our ancient enemy. And if we don't find this fragment, innocent humans will suffer.”

She knew exactly which buttons to push. Duty. Protection. Ancient grudges. And beneath it all, the unspoken current that had flowed between them since the transformation—the strange, uncomfortable awareness of each other as more than allies.

“You won't be entirely alone,” Mark added, misinterpreting Godzilla's hesitation. “We'll establish regular check-ins, and—”

“Fine,” Godzilla interrupted, his decision made. “But only until we find the fragment. Not a day longer.”

Relief washed across Mothra's face. “Of course.”

“Well, that was easier than expected,” boomed a voice from behind them.

They all turned to see Battra materializing through the solid wall, his dramatic entrance accompanied by a subtle puff of purple smoke. His arms were folded across his elaborate robes, a self-satisfied smirk playing on his lips.

“How long have you been there?” Mark demanded, hand over his heart.

“Long enough,” Battra replied vaguely, floating over to the tactical display. “So, I hear I'm to play the doting brother to my darling twin while you two play house. Sounds perfectly dreadful.” Despite his words, he looked positively delighted by the prospect.

Godzilla growled low in his throat. “No one said anything about 'doting.'”

“Oh, relax,” Battra waved a dismissive hand. “I'll be the difficult, judgmental brother who clearly disapproves of his sister's choice in husbands. Typecasting, really.” His crimson eyes gleamed with mischief. “Though I do think I should be consulted on the interior decorating. That living room is positively barbaric in its current design.”

“You won't be living with us,” Godzilla stated firmly.

“No, but I'll be visiting,” Battra countered. “Often and unannounced. Such is the way of troublesome relatives.”

Mark cleared his throat. “Battra has agreed to serve as your emergency contact. He'll pose as Maria's brother—”

“Maria?” Godzilla interrupted.

“Maria Lepidiel Nordson,” Mothra explained. “My cover identity. And you'll be Godric Nordson, former military, now a high school physics teacher.”

Godzilla stared at her. “You've already planned everything.”

She gave him a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. “I had faith you'd see reason.”

“Did you now?” he murmured, eyes narrowing slightly.

“A faith I shared,” Battra interjected cheerfully. “I've already taken the liberty of adding a few personal touches to your cover. Nothing major—just a few charming habits for dear Godric.” He produced a file from within his robes. “For instance, it says here that you're quite the baker. Known for your sourdough bread.”

Godzilla snatched the file. “I don't bake.”

“You do now,” Battra replied with a wink. “Just think of the possibilities. 'Godric Nordson, fearsome ex-military man who tenderly nurtures his sourdough starter each morning.' The housewives will swoon.”

“I will end you,” Godzilla growled.

“Not until after the mission,” Mark intervened, looking slightly pained. “Your departure is tomorrow morning. Cover stories, documentation, and necessary supplies are being prepared. Your primary mission is to locate and secure the Ghidorah fragment, but maintain your cover at all costs.”

“And do try to smile occasionally,” Battra added, floating backward toward the wall. “Nothing says 'I'm secretly a giant radioactive lizard' quite like perpetual scowling.” With that parting shot, he phased back through the solid surface, his laughter lingering in the air.

Godzilla gave a curt nod to Mark and strode from the room. As the door slid shut behind him, he heard Mark ask Mothra, “Are you sure about this? He doesn't seem…”

“He'll adapt,” Mothra answered with the confidence of someone who had known him for millions of years. “He always does.”

In the corridor, Godzilla paused, considering his options. He could refuse. He could insist on working alone. He could even simply leave Castle Bravo entirely—he was not, after all, bound to Monarch's commands.

But that would mean letting Mothra face Ghidorah's corruption alone.

With a resigned sigh, he continued walking. Domestic life. Human routines. Constant proximity to Mothra while pretending to be something they weren't.

His phone buzzed with an incoming text. Kong: “So is that a yes or no on the fight?”

Godzilla pocketed the phone without answering. Apparently, giant atomic lizards weren't the only ones who didn't take no for an answer.

What could possibly go wrong?
