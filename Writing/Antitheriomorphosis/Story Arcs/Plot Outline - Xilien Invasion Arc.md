# Plot Outline - Xilien Invasion Arc

### Battra's Return to Earth

- When the Divine Mandate weakened, Battra detected Earth's location
- Allied with the Xiliens to facilitate his return
- Chose a “longer roundabout way” to avoid alerting Earth's Titans to his return
- His caution demonstrates respect for his sister's power despite their rivalry
- Requires more development

### Battra's Multiple Lives Concept

- Prepared six additional lives stored in gems on a crown he wears
- Adaptation for his inability to create a Reincarnation Egg
- His circumvention of the Divine Covenant of the *Titanus msoura* was to exchange his ability to lay a Reincarnation Egg, having to share instead with his sister, in exchange for the ability to use magic
- Allows him to be “defeated” multiple times while maintaining threat level
