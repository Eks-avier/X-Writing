# Antitheriomorphosis

The name given to an unknown phenomenon that has seemingly turned nearly every Titan/Kaiju that are either native to Earth or had history with it into being in human bodies permanently; however, while they may appear completely *human*, they still possess all their abilities; albeit with some titans having to adjust for a time.

The only entity unaffected by this event was [[Battra, the Lord of the Mystic Arts]] and twin to Mothra whose mastery over the mystic arts immunized him from the effect.

- It seems that the “humanisation” process affected any and all titans who have made contact with Earth
	- Extraterrestrial giant monsters like Ghidorah and Gigan, who will appear at later stages of the narrative, have been transformed into humans as well.
	- These aliens dealing with the change of becoming humans will also be explored, eventually.

However, despite Battra's immunity, he prefers to keep a human form via advanced shape shifting techniques—he doesn't wanna be the odd one out after all. Besides, he has assumed a more humanoid form ever since his exile anyway—living in a fully human body is child's play to him.
