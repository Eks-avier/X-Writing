T# Titan Hierarchy System

## Dual Classification System

The Titan hierarchy operates on two parallel classification systems that work together to determine a Titan's overall status:

### Lineage System (Inherent Species Status)

- **Ascendant Lines** - Highest tier species with inherent biological advantages
- **Emergent Lines** - Rising species with developing evolutionary potential

Lineage determines inherent capabilities, with advantages manifesting in species-specific ways:
- *Titanus gojira*: Energy dominance and limitless adaptability
- *Titanus mosura*: Divine connection and psychic capabilities
- Other species have their own unique inherent advantages

### Standing System (Personal Achievement)

Regardless of Lineage, individual Titans can achieve various ranks through personal accomplishment:

#### Alpha Tier (Transcends Realms)

1. **Paramount** - Supreme authority over all Titans (Currently: Godzilla)
2. **Recognized Alphas**:
   - **Divine** - Spiritual authority acknowledging heavenly connection (Currently: Mothra)
   - **Sovereign** - Independent domain authority (Currently: Kong)

#### Beta Tier (Transcends Realms)

- **Beta** - Direct enforcer/lieutenant to the Paramount (Currently: Anguirus, Rodan)

#### World Above Hierarchy

1. **Cardinal Wardens** - Guardians of the four primary directions
2. **Intercardinal Wardens** - Guardians of intermediate directions
3. **Regionals** - Local guardians answering to their respective Warden
   - **Palace Custodian** - Special position as lowest intelligent rank (Currently: Barb)
4. **Territorials** - Semi-sentient beings with defined territories
5. **Primals** - Instinct-driven Titans requiring oversight

#### World Below Hierarchy

1. **Thresholders** - Highest level, closest to the surface
2. **Medianites** - Mid-level realms of Hollow Earth
3. **Abyssals** - The deepest regions
4. **Dwellers** - Primitive Titans of various habitats:
   - Earth Dwellers (land-based)
   - Void Dwellers (air-based)
   - Depth Dwellers (water-based)

#### Special Positions

- **Liminal Sentinel** - Guardian of the boundary between realms (Currently: Baragon)
- **Lord of the Mystic Arts** - Outside standard hierarchy (Currently: Battra)

## Political Dynamics of the Upper Hierarchy

### The Paramount Position

- Represents absolute authority over all Titans
- Has sole power to grant Recognized Alpha status (Divine or Sovereign)
- Historically, previous Paramounts rarely granted Sovereign status to avoid potential challengers
- Godzilla's approach differs, recognizing powerful Titans formally rather than forcing them into opposition

### Recognized Alphas

Titans who hold Alpha status without challenging the Paramount's ultimate authority:

#### Divine Status (Mothra)

- Created specifically to acknowledge Mothra's unique heavenly connection
- Equivalent authority to Sovereign but focused on spiritual matters and human relations
- Protected from Titan politics through the Godzilla-Mothra Vow
- Despite her qualifications, some Titans gossip that her position was granted due to her relationship with Godzilla
- This contributed to Godzilla creating the distinct “Divine” title to emphasize her legitimacy

#### Sovereign Status (Kong)

- Currently only held by Kong (Hollow Earth)
- Grants independent authority over a specific domain
- Multiple Sovereigns theoretically possible at Paramount's discretion
- Potentially a coveted position other powerful Titans might pursue
- Recognition process could involve trials or tournaments to prove worthiness

### Beta Tier

- Direct lieutenants to the Paramount, not subordinate to Recognized Alphas
- Hold authority recognized across both World Above and World Below
- Act as operational lynchpins connecting all levels of the hierarchy
- Anguirus (Stalwart Vanguard): Defensive specialist, Godzilla's right hand
- Rodan (Lord of the Skies): Aerial enforcer, Godzilla's left hand

## World Above Positions in Detail

### Cardinal Wardens

- Guardians of the four primary directions:
  - North: Leviathan
  - East: King Caesar (dormant)
  - South: Scylla
  - West: Behemoth

### Intercardinal Wardens

- Guardians of intermediate directions:
  - Northeast: Manda
  - Southeast: Bakunawa
  - Northwest: Amhuluk
  - Southwest: Quetzalcoatl

### Palace Custodian

- Special position as the lowest rank for intelligent Titans
- Currently held by Barb (the Turncoat Parasite/MUTO Queen)
- Caretaker of Monster Island Palace
- Willingly subservient despite intelligence and capabilities
- Position represents both punishment and redemption

## Special Positions

### Liminal Sentinel (Baragon)

- Guardian of the boundary between World Above and World Below
- Exists partially outside both hierarchies while connecting them
- Serves as advisor to Kong similar to how Anguirus serves Godzilla
- Has responsibilities in both realms
- Position reflects unique status as bridge between worlds

### Lord of the Mystic Arts (Battra)

- Outside standard hierarchy due to the Alpha Trinity Vow
- Connected to both upper hierarchy and humanity
- Not subordinate to other positions but bound by specific constraints
- Oversees supernatural education and magical development

## Cross-Realm Authority

The Alpha and Beta tiers maintain consistent authority regardless of realm:
- Godzilla's Paramount status grants him ultimate authority even in Hollow Earth
- Mothra's Divine status gives her spiritual authority across both realms
- Kong's Sovereign status is primarily focused on Hollow Earth but recognized elsewhere
- Betas like Anguirus and Rodan command respect and authority in either realm

This ensures continuity of leadership while allowing for specialized regional governance within each domain.

## Formal Court Protocols

### Court Announcements

- Paramount enters last, announced by a ceremonial vibration from Rodan
- Divine enters second-to-last, preceded by golden scales
- Sovereign enters third-to-last, announced by rhythmic Iwi drums
- Beta Tier enters together after Wardens are seated
- Wardens enter in order of their territories' relevance to the matter at hand
- Regional Titans and representatives enter first

### Speaking Order

1. Any Titan or representative may request to speak by formal gesture
2. Paramount acknowledges speaking rights in order of preference
3. Divine may interject on matters concerning human welfare
4. Wardens speak in order of their territories' relevance to the matter at hand
5. Regional Titans speak only when directly addressed or when their territory is discussed

## Post-Antitheriomorphosis Adaptations

Following transformation into human form, Titans have adapted their governance:
- The Monster Island Palace serves as the physical manifestation of their governance
- Formal court sessions held monthly with emergency sessions as needed
- Madison Russell unintentionally became the primary architect of Titan court ceremony
- While many Wardens possess hydrokinetic proxy abilities, these are personal capabilities rather than formal governance tools
