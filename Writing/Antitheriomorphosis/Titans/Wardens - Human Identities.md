# Warden Titan Human Identities

## Cardinal Wardens

### Leviathan (North)

- **Human Name:** Nathan Winters
- **Origin:** Self-created from (N)orth Levi(athan)
- **Surname Addition:** “Winters” reflects his Arctic domain
- **Madison's Contribution:** Minor tweaking of his self-selected name
- **Titan's Reaction:** Unusually proud of figuring out human naming conventions himself
- **Notable Quote:** “The name was obvious. I am surprised others required assistance.”
- **Usage Pattern:** Uses it formally and with dignity, viewing it as a logical extension of his title

### Scylla (South)

- **Human Name:** Scylla Frost (officially), often just “Scylla”
- **Origin:** Kept her original name, added surname for documentation
- **Reasoning:** “Why change what already works? Humans name their daughters stranger things.”
- **Madison's Input:** Suggested “Selene” but was politely rebuffed
- **Titan's Approach:** Uses it functionally, sees no need for disguise
- **Typical Response:** “If someone realizes I'm named after myself, they're already aware of too much.”
- **Documentation:** Official Monarch records list her as “S. Frost” in most contexts

### King Caesar (East)

- **Human Name:** Kai Shisa
- **Origin:** “Kai” (sea in Japanese), “Shisa” (Okinawan lion-dog guardian statue)
- **Selection Process:** Name chosen while still dormant by Monarch researchers
- **Current Status:** Name remains in official documentation though he hasn't awakened in human form
- **Cultural Connection:** Maintains ties to his Okinawan cultural origins
- **Preparedness Protocol:** Full identity papers and background exist in anticipation of awakening

### Behemoth (West)

- **Human Name:** Bram Sylvan
- **Origin:** “Bram” (shortened from “Abraham,” meaning “father of multitudes”), “Sylvan” (relating to woods)
- **Connection:** Reflects his role as protector of forests and ecological systems
- **Selection Style:** Chose a name suggesting ancient wisdom and natural authority
- **Madison's Notes:** “He wanted something that sounded like a wise forest steward”
- **Usage Pattern:** Enjoys using his human name, finds it appropriately dignified
- **Special Touch:** Signs conservation documents with a small leaf symbol beside his name

## Intercardinal Wardens

### Manda (Northeast)

- **Human Name:** Mizuki Ryūga
- **Origin:** “Mizuki” (beautiful moon/water), “Ryūga” (dragon fang)
- **Cultural Basis:** Maintained Japanese cultural connection reflecting Mu guardianship
- **Selection Process:** Aided by Madison Russell; the name selection went by smoother than expected
- **Name Function:** Professional enough for diplomatic interactions, distinctive enough for authority
- **Special Usage:** Uses only “M. Ryūga” in formal documentation

### Bakunawa (Southeast)

- **Human Name:** Bayani Habagat Luna
- **Origin:** “Bayani” (hero in Filipino), “Habagat” (southwest monsoon/rainy season), “Luna” (moon)
- **Three-Name Structure:** Different from Anguirus - reflects Filipino naming conventions rather than formal distinction
- **Ironic Twist:** Named “hero” despite traditionally being driven away in Filipino folklore
- **Cultural Authenticity:** Consulted Filipino Monarch personnel for cultural accuracy
- **Everyday Usage:** Goes by “Bayani Luna” in most contexts
- **Manda's Teasing:** Often points out the irony of the “hero” name for a being traditionally driven away.
- **Bakunawa's Defense:** “*Huwag nga kayong mga kontrabida.*”
- **Madison's Contribution:** Researched Filipino naming traditions to ensure cultural respect
- **Weather Connection:** “Habagat” reflects his command over water and the rainy season
- **Distinguishing Factor:** Uses three names for cultural reasons rather than formality, maintaining Anguirus's unique status

### Amhuluk (Northwest)

- **Human Name:** Atian Makya
- **Origin:** “Atian” (river or water spirit in Chinook), “Makya” (one who restores life in Native American traditions)
- **Cultural Foundation:** Drawn from Pacific Northwest Native American languages, particularly Chinook Jargon
- **Selection Process:** Worked with Native American cultural consultants at Monarch
- **Environmental Connection:** Name reflects his dual nature as water spirit and plant life restorer
- **Pronunciation:** Often has to correct others (ah-tee-ahn mak-yah)
- **Youth Factor:** As one of the younger Wardens, chose a name honoring ancestral traditions
- **Notable Quirk:** Signs documents with a small pictographic symbol showing water and plant growth
- **Sacred Significance:** Keeps a traditional cedar braid with his documents as a connection to his territory
- **Usage Pattern:** Formal with his name in official settings, sees it as honoring the peoples who recognized his spirit

### Quetzalcoatl (Southwest)

- **Human Name:** Quentin Venus Viento
- **Origin:** “Quentin” (fifth, maintaining initial “Q”), “Venus” (morning star associated with Quetzalcoatl in Mesoamerican cosmology), “Viento” (wind in Spanish)
- **Cultural Connection:** Triple name preserves Mesoamerican astronomical significance and Spanish influence
- **Selection Process:** Insisted on name reflecting his celestial associations
- **Madison's Challenge:** Finding something that honored his ancient significance while being functional
- **Compromise:** Agreed to “Quentin” only after extensive historical discussion about the letter Q
- **Special Feature:** Business cards include microscopic Mesoamerican calendar symbols
- **Venus Connection:** Often schedules important meetings during Venus's visibility phases
- **Formal Documentation:** Always includes his full title in parentheses after his human name on important documents

## Naming Patterns & Exceptions

### Consistency Factors

- Most Wardens maintain initial letters from their Titan names
- Cultural origins preserved where relevant (Japanese, Filipino, Mesoamerican)
- Environmental domains often reflected in surnames (Winters, Frost, Sylvan, Waters)

### Amusing Incidents

### The Nathan Club

- After learning his human name, Nathan Winters discovered the existence of both Nathan Draper (Psionic Division) and Nathan Lind (Hollow Earth Outpost)
- Amused by this coincidence, he formally invited them to what he called “The Nathan Convocation”
- The three now meet quarterly for what Monarch staff informally call “Nathan Club”
- Activities include discussing the etymology of their shared name, comparing professional observations, and a surprisingly competitive game night with Bakunawa often joining them.
- Nathan (Winters) made a group chat for all of them, where the other two Nathans are treated to crisp photos and videos of Arctic scenery from all kinds of exciting angles.
- The Nathans use their group chat as a gossip center.
- Nathan Winters takes immense pride in being the founder and organizer
- Madison's notes indicate he considers this “evidence of his superior naming instincts”
- Godzilla remains bewildered by the entire concept but allows it to continue
- Kevin secretly wants a 'Kevin Club' as well.
- Nathan Club meetings now have their own line item in the Monarch social activities budget

## Madison's Procedural Notes

> “Warden naming required more cultural research than any other group. Unlike the Alphas and Betas who I know personally, many Wardens maintain strong cultural ties to specific regions. I found myself consulting with various Monarch cultural experts to ensure appropriate names that honored their heritage while functioning in modern contexts.
>
> The cardinal/intercardinal distinction created interesting patterns - Cardinals tended toward simpler, more authoritative names while Intercardinals often embraced more complex cultural elements. The exception is Scylla, who simply couldn't be bothered with the entire exercise and kept her own name with minimal modification.
>
> Thankfully, Anguirus's three-name format remains distinctive since Bakunawa's triple name serves a different cultural purpose. Their different approaches to formality make this distinction clear - Anguirus uses his full name with military precision while Bakunawa's usage follows Filipino cultural patterns.”

## Documentation Standards

Monarch has established standardized documentation protocols for Warden identities:

- **Cardinal Wardens:** Primary listing uses full names; security clearance documentation includes directional designation
- **Intercardinal Wardens:** Documentation includes direction in parentheses after name
- **Cultural Accommodations:** Names appear in culturally appropriate order regardless of Western conventions
- **Pronunciation Guides:** All official documentation includes phonetic spelling to ensure proper address
- **Formal Address Protocol:** Official interactions require proper acknowledgment of Warden status regardless of human identity

## Administrative Challenges

The establishment of human identities for Wardens created several amusing administrative hurdles:

- **Geographic Origins:** Human resources struggled to create plausible birthplaces balancing security with cultural authenticity
- **Educational Background:** Fabricating appropriate credentials matching their expertise
- **Employment History:** Creating reasonable cover stories explaining their specialized knowledge
- **Tax Identification:** Several Wardens questioned why they needed to participate in human taxation systems
- **Passport Photos:** Specialized photography sessions with Titans struggling to appear “natural” for identification documents

Madison's conclusion on these challenges: “I never imagined my art degree would lead to coaching ancient beings on how to look natural for passport photos. The outtakes alone could fill a museum.”
