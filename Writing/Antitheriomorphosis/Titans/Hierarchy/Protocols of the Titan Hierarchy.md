# Protocols of the Titan Hierarchy

Monster Island Palace serves as the physical manifestation of Titan governance:

- Formal court sessions held monthly with emergency sessions as needed
- Position in court room physically reflects hierarchical standing
- Specific architectural features reinforce status distinctions
- Madison Russell unintentionally became the primary architect of Titan court ceremony

### Entry Protocol

1. Regional Titans and representatives enter first
2. Wardens enter in order: North, East, South, West, followed by intercardinal directions
3. Beta Tier enters together after Wardens are seated
4. Sovereign Alpha enters third-to-last
5. Divine Alpha enters second-to-last
6. Paramount enters last

### Announcement Protocol

- **Paramount:** No formal announcement - his presence is marked by an overwhelming aura of atomic energy that permeates the court, creating a palpable weight that all beings instinctively recognize
- **Divine:** Announced either by the reflection of light from her scales throughout the chamber or by the ceremonial chants of the Shobijin (twin priestesses)
- **Sovereign:** Announced by rhythmic ceremonial drums from Iwi representatives
- **Lord of the Mystic Arts:** Self-announces through subtle magical display
- **Beta Tier:** Announced by unified formal salute from Wardens
- **Wardens:** Announced by their respective Regional representatives

### Speaking Order

1. Any Titan or representative may request to speak by formal gesture
2. Paramount acknowledges speaking rights in order of preference
3. Divine Alpha may interject on matters concerning human welfare
4. Wardens speak in order of their territories' relevance to the matter at hand
5. Regional Titans speak only when directly addressed or when their territory is discussed

### Address Protocol

- Never address higher-ranked Titans by name alone
- Always use proper title when addressing superiors
- Subordinates may be addressed by name or position at superior's discretion
- Equals may use less formal address in private settings
- Full formal address required for all court proceedings regardless of rank

### Petition Protocol

- Formal petitions presented while kneeling (Regional Titans and below)
- Wardens present petitions standing with heads slightly bowed
- Beta Tier presents requests rather than petitions, standing at full height
- All petitions addressed to Paramount regardless of subject matter
- Divine Alpha and Sovereign Alpha may endorse petitions with formal gestures

## Communication Styles by Rank

### Paramount

- Commands given directly and expected to be obeyed without question
- Rarely explains decisions but may provide rationale to Alpha Consort or Regent
- Physical gestures (head movement, eyes, posture) carry significant weight
- Silence itself is often a form of communication
- May communicate through energy signatures when emphasizing importance

### Divine

- Communication often incorporates subtle energy fluctuations
- Speaks with dual meaning - surface meaning for most, deeper meaning for those attuned
- Questions posed as gentle guidance rather than direct commands
- Often communicates through proxies (the twins) for routine matters
- Uses scales as communication medium when privacy is required

### Sovereign

- Direct, clear communication reflecting warrior background
- Uses sign language developed with previous Kong generations
- Strategic mixture of suggestion and command depending on situation
- Incorporates physical demonstrations when verbal communication insufficient
- Often uses Iwi as translators when nuance is required

### Beta Tier

- Formal, procedural communication when representing Alpha Paramount
- More casual, direct style when acting on own authority
- Specific vocal patterns inform listeners of whether speaking personally or officially
- Permitted to speak freely in closed council with Alpha Paramount
- Must maintain formal address in public settings

### Wardens

- Highly ritualized reporting structure with specific terminology
- Communication primarily territory-focused and problem-oriented
- Required to present situations objectively before offering opinions
- Speak to lower Titans in formal cascade of authority
- Must request permission to address Alphas directly in court settings

### Regional Titans

- Formal, deferential communication with higher ranks
- Practical, direct communication regarding territorial matters
- Required to communicate through chain of command except in emergencies
- Use of human intermediaries increasing since Antitheriomorphosis
- Symbolic gestures and displays remain important even in human form
