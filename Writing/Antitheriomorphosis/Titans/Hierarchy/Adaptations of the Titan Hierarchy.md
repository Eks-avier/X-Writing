# Adaptions of the Titan Hierarchy

Following transformation into human form, Titans have adapted their governance:

### Physical Adaptations

- Throne room scaled to human proportions while maintaining hierarchical layout
- Regalia miniaturized but maintains symbolic significance
- Energy signatures reduced but still perceptible to other Titans
- Formal gestures modified to accommodate human physiology
- Communication protocols adjusted for human vocal capabilities

### Procedural Adaptations

- More frequent court sessions due to increased complexity of human-form existence
- Introduction of written documentation alongside traditional memory-based records
- Use of technology to maintain surveillance and communication across territories
- Integration of human assistants (primarily Monarch personnel) for logistical support
- Development of human-compatible identification systems and security protocols

### Cultural Adaptations

- Formal ceremonies modified to accommodate human limitations
- Development of human-form regalia that references Titan characteristics
- Creation of specific honorifics and forms of address appropriate for human interaction
- Adjustment of hierarchical displays to be less intimidating to human observers
- Integration of human cultural elements that parallel Titan traditions

## Human Identity Administration

Following the Antitheriomorphosis, comprehensive identity frameworks were established:

### Documentation Standards

Monarch has established standardized documentation protocols for Titan identities:

- **Alpha Tier:** Primary listing uses full names; security clearance documentation includes hierarchical designation
- **Beta Tier:** Documentation includes position in parentheses after name
- **Warden Tier:** Documentation includes directional designation
- **Cultural Accommodations:** Names appear in culturally appropriate order regardless of Western conventions
- **Pronunciation Guides:** All official documentation includes phonetic spelling to ensure proper address
- **Formal Address Protocol:** Official interactions require proper acknowledgment of hierarchical status regardless of human identity

### Madison Russell's Contribution

Madison Russell played a key role in both the creation of the Monster Island Palace design and the humanization process:

> “The hierarchy needed a physical manifestation that would work in human form while honoring ancient traditions. What started as teenage sketches somehow became the blueprint for their entire governance structure. I never imagined my art project would literally become the architectural foundation for a new era of Titan society.
>
> The naming conventions required extensive consultation with each Titan to find identities that honored their nature while functioning in human society. Some, like Scylla, simply couldn't be bothered with the exercise. Others, like Leviathan, took immense pride in creating their own names with minimal assistance.
>
> The most fascinating part was watching them develop their human-form regalia. They translated their Titan characteristics into wearable symbols that still managed to convey their status and power. It's like watching living mythology adapt itself to a new era.”
