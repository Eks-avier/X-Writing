# Power Hierarchy of the Titans

Alongside the formal standing system, an unofficial hierarchy based on raw power exists:

1. Godzilla (immutably first)
2. Mothra (immutably second)
3. Battra (claimed third position after arrival)
4. Scylla (source of Rodan's irritation)
5. Rodan/Leviathan (fluctuating positions)

This creates fascinating tension between official authority and recognized capability, with Kong particularly notable for being technically “weaker” in raw power but higher in the formal hierarchy due to his resourcefulness and intelligence.
