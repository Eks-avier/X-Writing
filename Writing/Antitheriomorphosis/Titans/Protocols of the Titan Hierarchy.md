Formal Court Protocols

### Court Structure

Monster Island Palace serves as the physical manifestation of Titan governance:

- Formal court sessions held monthly with emergency sessions as needed
- Position in court room physically reflects hierarchical standing
- Specific architectural features reinforce status distinctions
- Madison Russell unintentionally became the primary architect of Titan court ceremony

3. Beta Tier enters together after Wardens are seated
4. Sovereign Alpha enters third-to-last
5. Divine Alpha enters second-to-last

### Announcement Protocol

- **Paramount:** No formal announcement - his presence is marked by an overwhelming aura of atomic energy that permeates the court, creating a palpable weight that all beings instinctively recognize
