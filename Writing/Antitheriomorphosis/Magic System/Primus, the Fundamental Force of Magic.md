# PRIMUS: THE FOUNDATION OF MAGIC

## Cosmic Fundamental Force

### I. Fundamental Nature

* **Definition:** Primus exists as the fifth fundamental force of nature alongside gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force.
* **Properties:** Unlike other stable cosmic forces, Primus exists in a perpetually unstable state, continuously seeking transformation.
* **Universal Presence:** Primus permeates the cosmos as the raw essence of all magical phenomena, governing supernatural manifestations across reality.

### II. Transformation Process

* **Basic Principle:** All magic fundamentally operates through the structured conversion of Primus into specific energy forms.
* **Stabilization Mechanism:** Contact with a sorcerer's soul involuntarily transforms raw Primus into Structured Primus, its stable and usable form.
* **Exception:** Battra alone possesses the ability to halt this transformation process, enabling manipulation of Primus in its raw state, though with limited mastery.

### III. Soul Interaction

* **Functional Role:** The soul serves as both catalyst and stabilizer, shaping raw Primus into specific magical patterns.
* **Efficiency Correlation:** Soul strength directly corresponds to refinement capability, with stronger souls producing more efficient and controlled magical effects.
* **Null Species Classification:** Certain species (including Titanus Gojira) lack the innate capacity to perceive or manipulate Primus, classified as “Null.”
* **Personalization Factor:** Each sorcerer shapes Primus uniquely according to their soul's individual nature, making magic an inherently personal expression.

### IV. Primus Ignition

* **Definition:** The preliminary phase of spellcasting where raw Primus is gathered and converted to Structured Primus.
* **Skill Correlation:** Ignition speed varies proportionally with expertise—masters achieve instantaneous ignition.
* **Casting Sequence:** Ignition necessarily precedes visualization and verbal components, constituting the foundational phase of all magical practice.
* **Detection Vulnerability:** Advanced practitioners (notably Battra) can sense the ignition spark in other sorcerers, enabling spell detection before formal casting.

### V. Commitment Influence

* **Structural Impact:** Commitments modify Primus behavior within spells, reinforcing magical structure.
* **Instability Consequence:** Violation of established Commitments introduces instability in Primus-based magic, potentially resulting in spell failure or unintended effects.

### VI. Human Magical History

* **Divine Intervention:** Mothra's Divine Mandate forcibly severed humanity's ability to perceive Primus, rendering the species Null.
* **Historical Consequence:** This severance directly precipitated the collapse of ancient magical civilizations, most notably Atlantis.
* **Scientific Misinterpretation:** What modern human science classifies as Dark Matter and Dark Energy represents actual Primus and alien magical constructs, rendered imperceptible by the Divine Mandate.
* **Contemporary Revival:** The recent lifting of the Mandate has enabled humanity to rediscover magical practice, though ancient knowledge remains largely unrecoverable.

### VII. Cosmic Context

* **Universal Normalcy:** Most civilizations throughout the universe naturally perceive and integrate Primus into their societies.
* **Methodological Variation:** Approaches to Primus range from scientific (spell refinement through research) to religious (divine manifestation).
* **Optimization Hierarchy:** Battra stands as the most efficient sorcerer in existence, having refined Primus manipulation to its theoretical limit, achieving perfect magical optimization.

## Fundamental Principles

1. Primus exists as an omnipresent unstable force requiring transformation for magical utilization.
2. Structured Primus constitutes the manipulable form of magic, shaped by individual soul characteristics.
3. Null species lack intrinsic Primus interaction capability, with certain divine exceptions.
4. Commitments function as regulatory frameworks for Primus-based magic.
5. Humanity's magical perception was historically eliminated through Mothra's Divine Mandate.
6. Battra has achieved unparalleled Primus manipulation efficiency, establishing the theoretical ceiling of magical optimization.
