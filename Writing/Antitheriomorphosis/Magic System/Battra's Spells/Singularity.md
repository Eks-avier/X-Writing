# Singularity Technique

## Description

- Creates a controlled singularity, forming a **black hole** at designated coordinates in space
- One of the **5 techniques/spells that are maximally optimized** by Battra
- Primarily falls under the **Object-Oriented Magic** paradigm, functioning as a “class” containing multiple related spells. It is formally a Technique.
- Comprises two core spells that work in synergy:
  - **Convergence**: Forces matter to compress toward a single point
  - **Coordination**: Creates a Cartesian framework for precise spatial control

### Core Mechanics

- **Black Hole Formation**: Creates a point of infinite density, causing space-time to curve beyond escape velocity
- **Event Horizon**: A passive sub-technique that forms automatically, creating a boundary beyond which nothing can escape
- **Reversibility**: Can be inverted to create a **white hole** instead (Expulse variation)
- **Scale Control**: Can be calibrated from microscopic to potentially planet-destroying (though Battra rarely uses this scale)

### Energy Considerations

- **True vs. Magical Singularities**:
  - Initial versions created “magical singularities” powered by Battra's energy (high cost, vulnerable to counter-magic)
  - Advanced versions create “true singularities” where magic is only used for control, not generation (lower cost, resistant to counter-magic)
- **Control Requirements**:
  - Maintaining precise control of an actual singularity requires immense concentration
  - For non-planetary scale singularities, Battra has optimized away the charge time
  - Energy cost is proportional to singularity size and duration, but negligible for Battra due to his efficiency

## Historical Origin

The Singularity Technique emerged from Battra's unique ability to see connections between seemingly unrelated concepts:

1. **Convergence Origin**:
   - Gifted to Battra by an alien mentor who died naturally after 120 years
   - Originally considered a “pointless compression spell” that merely pushed matter together
   - Kept by Battra primarily as a memento of his relationship with the mentor

2. **Coordination Origin**:
   - Acquired from a fallen student who used it defensively by creating barriers along connected points.
   - Originally created a Cartesian coordinate system in space to generate protective barriers
   - Preserved by Battra in memory of his student's protective nature

3. **Development Period**:
   - Spent thousands of years observing a civilization living on a red dwarf orbiting a black hole
   - Extended period was required not for conceptualization, but for energy optimization
   - Conducted experiments in specially created pocket dimensions to contain potential disasters

## Incantation & Chants

### Collapse (Black Hole) Variation

**Full Incantation:**
> Bright stars shine, then bloat,
> In a final flash, their cores implode.
> From their end, a feasting void,
> Collapse… Singularity

**Long Chant (120% Power):**
> Bloat, Implode, Feast, Collapse… Singularity

**Short Chant (100% Power):**
> Collapse… Singularity

### Expulse (White Hole) Variation

**Full Incantation:**
> Unbound from eternal darkness,
> Untethered from the void,
> From the feasting abyss,
> Unleash all that has been consumed,
> Expulse… Singularity

**Long Chant (120% Power):**
> Untethered, Unbound, Unleash, Expulse… Singularity

**Short Chant (100% Power):**
> Expulse, Singularity!

## Performance Mechanics

- **Longer Incantations** enable Battra to:
  - Boost output power by approximately 120%
  - Layer additional effects onto the spell before casting
  - “Break the limits” of the spell, pushing output to ~500% under optimal conditions

- **Shorter Chants** provide:
  - Standard 100% power with minimal verbal components
  - Faster casting speed and less telegraphing to opponents
  - Efficiency at the cost of maximum power
- **Silent Casting**:
  - Requires perfect visualization of the entire technique
  - When mastered, maintains full power while eliminating verbal components

## Combat Applications

### Offensive Tactics

1. **Precision Targeting**:
   - Micro-singularities can target specific opponents or objects
   - The Coordination framework allows pinpoint placement
   - Can be used to remove specific threats without collateral damage

2. **Area Denial**:
   - Medium-scale singularities control battlefield movement
   - Event horizons create impassable barriers
   - Gravitational effects disrupt enemy positioning

3. **Ultimate Weapon**:
   - Larger singularities capable of consuming entire structures or armies
   - At maximum scale, potentially planet-destroying (though Battra avoids this use)

### Defensive Applications

1. **White Hole Shield** (Expulse Variation):
   - Creates a repulsive force field that nothing can penetrate
   - Can be shaped using the Coordination framework
   - Perfect defense against physical and energy attacks

2. **Attack Absorption**:
   - Small singularities can capture and consume incoming attacks
   - Particularly effective against energy-based assaults
   - Converts enemy attacks into additional power for the technique

3. **Gravitational Manipulation**:
   - Alters local gravity to disrupt enemy movement
   - Creates zones of increased or decreased weight
   - Can be used to strand flying opponents or increase mobility

### Tactical Versatility

1. **State Transition**:
   - Seamless switching between attractive (Collapse) and repulsive (Expulse) states
   - Can trap opponents by suddenly reversing gravitational flow

2. **Multi-Point Deployment**:
   - The Coordination framework allows multiple singularities simultaneously
   - Creates complex gravitational landscapes
   - Requires immense concentration but offers unparalleled battlefield control

## Philosophical Significance

The Singularity Technique embodies several key aspects of Battra's approach to magic:

1. **Transforming Memory into Mastery**:
   - Both component spells were kept initially as memories of important relationships
   - Battra transformed these emotional attachments into technical excellence
   - Demonstrates how he honors connections while advancing his craft

2. **The Value of “Pointless” Knowledge**:
   - A spell dismissed as “pointless” by its original user became universe-altering in Battra's hands
   - Demonstrates his belief that no knowledge is truly without value
   - Reinforces his teaching philosophy that fundamentals matter more than flashy applications

3. **Finding Power in Simplicity**:
   - Simple compression + coordinate system = reality-bending power
   - Shows that his greatest strengths come from understanding fundamentals rather than complex techniques
   - Parallels Twin Cutters Technique in transforming basic concepts into cosmic forces

4. **The Ultimate Expression of Control**:
   - Manipulates one of the most powerful forces in the universe through precision rather than brute force
   - Represents his philosophy that anything can be controlled with sufficient understanding
   - Stands as a testament to his belief that there are no true limits to magical mastery

5. **The Value of Time and Patience**:
   - Thousands of years of refinement transformed modest spells into cosmic-level power
   - Showcases how his immortality becomes a strength through persistent improvement
   - Demonstrates the rewards of methodical optimization over quick results

## Mastery Requirements

The Singularity Technique demands exceptional capabilities from its caster:

1. **Visualization Requirements**:
   - Perfect spatial awareness of the coordinate system
   - Ability to conceptualize infinite density in finite space
   - Complete understanding of gravitational physics and relativity

2. **Multitasking Capacity**:
   - Simultaneous maintenance of the Coordination framework
   - Precise control of convergence/divergence forces
   - Continuous monitoring of event horizon boundaries

3. **Knowledge Integration**:
   - Requires synthesizing mathematical, physical, and magical principles
   - Demands understanding across multiple scientific domains
   - Exemplifies Battra's cross-disciplinary approach to magic

Beyond its immense power, the Singularity Technique serves as the perfect example of Battra's genius: seeing connections others miss, recognizing the extraordinary potential in seemingly simple concepts, and having the patience to transform basic spells into cosmic forces through methodical refinement and fundamental understanding.
