# Titans, Magic, and Psionics

## The Divine Mandate Against Sorcery (DMAS)

The Divine Mandate Against Sorcery was a cosmic decree issued by Mothra that fundamentally altered humanity's relationship with magic:

- **Origin**: During the Golden Age of Atlantis, a human tribe discovered how to modify souls—both their own and others'—which was forbidden by cosmic law
- **Divine Judgment**: Mothra, as the Divine Instance and filled with grief over her first human friends from the Eclipse civilization, annihilated the tribe completely
- **The Mandate**: Mothra issued the DMAS, which disabled humanity's perception of Primus (the fifth fundamental force enabling magic) and turned humanity into “Null” beings
- **Current Status**: Mothra no longer actively reinforces the DMAS, allowing only 10 young sorcerers to practice magic
- **Theory**: Both Godzilla and Battra independently believe this is a test for Battra—if he can prove himself as a responsible teacher, Mothra may fully lift the Mandate

## Dual Supernatural Systems

The world contains two distinct but complementary supernatural systems:

### Sorcery (Mystic Arts)

- **Source**: Requires manipulation of Primus through the soul
- **Nature**: Connected to Heaven's domain, as souls are governed by divine authority
- **History**: Was available to all humans until the DMAS
- **Teacher**: Battra was the original teacher of human sorcery
- **Current Status**: Limited to 10 young sorcerers at Keep Charlie

### Psionic Arts

- **Source**: Requires the mind, genetically determined
- **Nature**: Rooted in the physical, mortal brain rather than the divine soul
- **History**: Dormant while Titans hibernated, reawakened when Mothra returned in 2019
- **Awakening**: When Mothra unfurled her wings after a thousand years, she released a psionic shockwave that reactivated humanity's psychic potential
- **Teacher**: Primarily taught by Battra, with Mothra as a guest teacher for advanced, intuitive concepts

### The Cosmic Irony of the Twin Teachers

- **Battra**: Despite despising her sister's divinity, now teaches an art fundamentally connected to Heaven's domain (the soul)
- **Mothra**: Despite carrying the divine soul of the Heavenly Instance, excels at and teaches abilities that stem from the mortal mind
- **Character Reflection**: This irony encapsulates their essence—Mothra's devotion to Earth despite her divinity, and Battra's pursuit of divine-like power despite his mortal origin

## Primus Interaction Spectrum

Different beings interact with Primus in various ways:

1. **Pure Sorcerers** (human magic users): Consciously shape Primus through structured techniques
2. **Elemental Titans**: Instinctively manipulate Primus for specific elemental control (like Rodan's aerokinesis)
3. **Specialized Beings** (like Battra): Can utilize both magical and psychic abilities
4. **Energy Manipulators** (like Godzilla): Work with energy rather than Primus
5. **Null Beings**: Cannot perceive or interact with Primus at all

## Key Institutions

### Keep Charlie

- A mystical educational facility housed within Castle Bravo
- Established by Battra following the Xillien Invasion
- Features specialized sections for mystic arts training, psychic abilities development, and junior students
- Connected to Castle Bravo via the Wall Walk

### Castle Bravo

- Monarch's mobile fortress headquarters
- Houses both scientific/military personnel and the supernatural students
- Features areas like the “Hanger-Out” for social gatherings
- Maintained by Methuselah, who serves as the janitorial service

## Special Cases

### Psychic-Sorcerers

- **Battra**: Naturally psychic as a Divine Moth, gained sorcery by circumventing his species' Covenant
- **Two Junior Students**: The only humans with both abilities, specially protected by Battra
- **Prodigal Psychic**: Among the three junior students is also a child prodigy with exceptional psychic abilities
- **Humanity's Potential**: Unlike most species in the universe, humans can potentially access both supernatural systems
- **Complementary Nature**: Magic and psionics, while distinct in their sources (soul vs. mind), complement each other in practice

### Titans and Power

- **Godzilla**: Dominates energy itself but cannot use magic (Null species)
- **Mothra**: Supreme psychic ability and divine authority (Null species)
- **Kong**: Null being who relies on physical prowess and intelligence (Null species)
- **Elemental Titans**: Specialized Primus manipulation for controlling specific elements

## The Monsterverse Dynamic

The current world features a complex integration of Titans, humans, and supernatural abilities:
- Titans transformed into human form by Antitheriomorphosis
- Monarch working alongside Titans
- Keep Charlie training the next generation of sorcerers and psychics
- A hierarchy of Titans with Godzilla and Mothra at the top
- Limited magic use due to the ongoing effects of the DMAS
- Growing psionic potential in humanity
