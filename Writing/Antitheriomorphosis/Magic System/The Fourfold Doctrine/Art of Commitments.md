# Art of Commitments

Commitments represent one pillar of the [[Fourfold Doctrine of Sorcery]], alongside the [[Art of Spell Casting]], the [[Art of Spell Optimization]], and the [[Art of Spell Keeping]]. While not the foundation of magic itself, Commitments are powerful structures that interact with [[Primus]], the 5th fundamental force of nature. Once thought to be exclusive to sorcerers, it was later discovered that even those who are [[The Null|Null]] may be able to invoke certain types of Commitments if they possess an indomitable soul.

> [!info] Core Concept
> A Commitment is a binding magical structure that shapes Primus through sacrifices and promises. Breaking a Commitment causes Primus to mutate unpredictably, often with catastrophic consequences.

## I. Fundamental Nature

Commitments function as structured abstractions over Primus, which is inherently unstable and seeks transformation. They shape and stabilize Primus, creating predictable magical patterns. If a Commitment is broken, Primus mutates unpredictably—often leading to catastrophic consequences.

### Core Properties

- **Soul Interaction**: All Commitments operate through [[Soul Resonance]] - the harmonic interaction between [[The Soul|souls]] that creates patterns affecting Primus
- **Sacrifice Requirement**: Every Commitment demands specific, concrete sacrifices proportional to the power granted
- **Divine Oversight**: Heaven serves as witness and enforcer for all Commitments
- **Consequence Mechanism**: Breaking a Commitment triggers predictable severity but unpredictable manifestation
- **Pattern Stability**: Strong Commitments create persistent patterns in Primus, enabling long-term magical effects

### Soul Interaction Framework

All Commitments operate through [[Soul Resonance]], which functions via two distinct pathways:

#### Horizontal Pathway (Soul-to-Soul)

- Direct resonance between souls, with Heaven as witness
- Available to all beings with souls, including Null species
- Basis for Mutual Commitments between individuals

#### Vertical Pathway (Soul-to-Primus)

- Direct soul manipulation of Primus through [[Soul Infusion]]
- Limited to beings capable of magical practice
- Required for Self-Commitments

This dual pathway system explains why some Commitments remain accessible to Null beings while others require magical aptitude.

> For detailed exploration of these pathways, see [[Soul Resonance]]

### Implicit vs. Explicit Commitments

Commitments can be either explicitly formed through conscious intent or implicitly created through magical practice:

- **Explicit Commitments**: Consciously established agreements with clearly defined terms and consequences
- **Implicit Commitments**: Unconsciously formed through magical practices like incantations and gestures, where the practitioner trades effort for magical effect without necessarily recognizing the underlying Commitment structure

> [!example] Implicit Contract Example
> When a sorcerer uses a shortened chant instead of a full incantation, they implicitly form a Contract trading reduced casting time for reduced effect. This proportional relationship operates as a Contract regardless of whether the sorcerer recognizes it as such.

> [!note] Related Topics
> For a complete analysis of implicit magical structures, see [[Implicit vs. Explicit Commitments]]

## II. Commitment Categories

Commitments fall into two fundamental categories based on how they operate:

### 1. Self-Commitments

_Requires both Soul Infusion and Soul Resonance, inaccessible to Null beings_

These are personal commitments made by an individual that shape their own magical practice:

|Commitment Type|Punishment for Breaking|
|---|---|
|Contracts|Loss of bonus effect or enhancement|
|Promises|Temporary curse|
|Oaths|Loss of identity & power|
|Vows|Permanent curse, proportional to soul strength|
|Covenants|None (cannot be broken)|

### 2. Mutual Commitments

_Requires at least the capability of Soul Resonance, some accessible to Null beings_

These involve commitments between two or more individuals, with Heaven serving as witness:

|Commitment Type|Punishment for Breaking|
|---|---|
|Contracts|As dictated by contract terms|
|Promises|Permanent curse|
|Oaths|Collective loss of identity and power|
|Vows|Guaranteed, unpredictable death|
|Covenants|Impossible to break (divine agreement)|

> [!warning] Third-Party Involvement
> Individuals can become unwittingly incorporated into Mutual Commitments without their knowledge or consent, potentially subjecting them to consequences without receiving benefits.

> [!note] Related Topics
> For detailed examination of unwitting incorporation, see [[Third-Party Commitment Incorporation]]

## III. The Five Commitments in Detail

### Comprehensive Commitment Comparison

|Commitment Type|Self-Commitment|Mutual Commitment|Unique Trait|Null Access|Enhancement Potential|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Contracts|Technical, specific|Transactional|Logical, precise|No|20-50%|
|Promises|Belief-based|Conviction-bound|Based on belief|Yes|None|
|Oaths|Identity-aligned|Group-binding|Binds identity and duty|Yes (Mutual only)|None|
|Vows|Soul-bound|Death-enforced|Personal, eternal|Yes (Mutual only)|75-120%|
|Covenants|Divine-granted|Divine-witnessed|Divine authority|Yes (Mutual only)|Unlimited|

### 1. Contracts – Technical Frameworks

Contracts are the most common technical Commitment, serving as essential tools in everyday sorcery.

#### Core Mechanics

- Shape and stabilize Primus, acting like a structured spell-enhancement framework
- Self-Contracts create frameworks that enhance specific aspects of spellcasting
- Mutual Contracts are transactional—if one party fails, they suffer the agreed-upon consequence
- Breaking a Contract collapses the structured magic instantly, like a toppled Jenga tower

#### Applications

- **Targeted Enhancement**: Improve specific spell elements (typically 20-50% improvement)
- **Activation Conditions**: Function under clearly defined circumstances or actions
- **Duration**: Temporary, lasting until contract conditions expire
- **Required Sacrifice**: Must involve concrete trade-offs related to the enhancement sought

#### Time-Bound Nature

- Contracts have defined beginning and end points
- Can be renewed, modified, or allowed to expire
- Ideal for evolving techniques that require flexibility
- Perfect for experimental magical development

#### Limitations

- Contracts can stabilize experimental spells, but only the known portions
- Conflicting Contracts interact sequentially, like buffs and debuffs in a game
- Contracts can be layered, but reckless layering can destabilize magic
- **Null Access**: Inaccessible to Null beings as they require direct Primus manipulation through [[Soul Infusion]]

> [!example] Practical Contract
> “I commit to practicing fire manipulation for four hours daily for the next month. In exchange, my fire spells will maintain stability for 30% longer during this period.”

> [!note] Related Topics
> For practical applications and techniques, see [[Magical Contracts - Applications and Techniques]]

### 2. Promises – The Power of Conviction

Promises are unique because they rely not on magical ability, but on sheer belief and conviction. Unlike technical Commitments, they shape character and social dynamics rather than enhancing magical capability.

#### Core Mechanics

- Based on conviction rather than technical precision
- Anyone can make a Promise, including Null individuals with [[Soul Resonance]] capability
- Breaking a Promise always results in a Curse on the promiser
- The severity of the Curse depends on the strength of the broken Promise

#### Applications

- Establishing personal codes of conduct
- Creating binding declarations of intent
- Demonstrating character integrity
- Establishing narrative stakes

#### Unique Properties

- A Null's Promise can unintentionally generate magic if their conviction is absolute
- While rare, a Null's Promise can last for generations, but only if they are long-lived
- Sorcerers are wary of Nulls making Promises—not because they always cause magic, but because the Null themselves is terrifying if fully committed

> [!example] Powerful Promise
> “I promise to never use my knowledge to harm an innocent. Should I break this promise, may my power turn against me.”

> [!note] Related Topics
> For deeper exploration of conviction-based magic, see [[The Power of Conviction - Promise Magic]]

### 3. Oaths – Binding Duty and Identity

Oaths are Commitments of allegiance, sworn duty, and identity. Unlike Promises, which are personal, and Vows, which are soul-bound, Oaths connect individuals to a larger cause, group, or purpose. They shape social connections rather than enhancing magical capability.

#### Core Mechanics

- Connect individual identity to a larger purpose or group
- Breaking a Self-Oath results in Oathbreaker Status—disabling magic and new Commitments
- Mutual Oaths, when broken, erase the group's collective legacy and power
- Oathbreaker status can only be removed through redemption or intervention

#### Applications

- Define character roles in organizations
- Establish group dynamics and hierarchies
- Create formal bonds between individuals and institutions
- Establish responsibilities and expectations

#### Cultural Variations

- Different cultures punish Oathbreakers with exile, death, or ritual cleansing
- **Null Access**: Self-Oaths are inaccessible to Null beings as they require [[Soul Infusion]], but Mutual Oaths can be formed through [[Soul Resonance]]

> [!example] Identity Oath
> “I swear on my name and power that I shall uphold the principles of Keep Charlie, protecting its knowledge and students with my life and magic.”

> [!note] Related Topics
> For detailed examination of identity-based magic, see [[Identity Magic - The Power of Oaths]]

### 4. Vows – Soul-Etched Permanence

Vows are the strongest personal Commitments, integrated with the soul itself through advanced [[Soul Resonance]] patterns.

#### Core Mechanics

- Directly bind to the soul, persisting beyond death
- Breaking a Vow results in punishment proportional to soul strength
- Mutual Vows, when broken, invariably result in death

#### Applications

- Comprehensive enhancement of magical practice (75-120% improvement)
- Establishing absolute rules for techniques
- Creating permanent foundations for advanced magical systems

#### The Element of Permanence

- Vows can never be truly broken or undone, only replaced with another Vow
- They become integral to the sorcerer's identity and magical practice
- Perfect for establishing foundational rules of powerful techniques
- **Null Access**: Self-Vows require [[Soul Infusion]] and are inaccessible to Null beings. Mutual Vows are accessible to Null beings with sufficient soul strength.

> [!example] Soul-Binding Vow
> “I vow to surrender independent use of Convergence and Coordination in exchange for perfect integration within the Singularity Technique.”

> [!note] Related Topics
> For exploration of soul-binding mechanisms, see [[Soul-Binding]]

### 5. Covenants – The Divine Agreement

Covenants are the strongest and rarest type of Commitment, formed only between a Mortal and a Divine.

#### Core Mechanics

- Represent divine-level agreements that reshape fundamental existence
- Covenants cannot be broken—attempting to do so results in ultimate damnation
- Only known Covenant: [[Titanus mosura]] traded magic for immortality
- **Null Access**: Null beings cannot initiate Self-Covenants (requiring [[Soul Infusion]]), but can participate in Mutual Covenants established by divine beings

#### Divine Integration

- Covenants operate at the highest level of reality, altering the fundamental nature of participants
- Effects can extend to entire species or lineages
- Once established, become effectively immutable aspects of cosmic order

> [!example] Historical Covenant
> The Divine Moths accepted a Covenant with Heaven, trading their magical aptitude for true immortality through reincarnation.

> [!note] Related Topics
> For analysis of known divine agreements, see [[Known Covenants Throughout History]]

## IV. Technical vs. Non-Technical Commitments

A fundamental distinction exists between Commitments that enhance magical capability and those that shape character and social dynamics:

### Technical Commitments (Enhance Magic)

- **Contracts**: Time-bound frameworks that provide flexible enhancement
- **Vows**: Permanent, soul-etched foundations that establish absolute conditions

### Non-Technical Commitments (Shape Character)

- **Promises**: Conviction-based declarations that demonstrate integrity
- **Oaths**: Identity-aligned bonds that connect individuals to groups or causes

This distinction creates natural progression paths for sorcerers:
- Beginners rely primarily on Contracts for enhancement
- Masters may use Vows to achieve maximum efficiency
- All practitioners use Promises and Oaths to define themselves socially

> [!note] Related Topics
> For pedagogical approaches to teaching this distinction, see [[Teaching Commitments - Technical vs. Non-Technical Approaches]]

## V. Technique Development Through Commitments

The relationship between Commitments and [[Spellcasting Paradigms|Object-Oriented Magic]] creates a sophisticated system for technique development:

### Contracts as Flexible Implementation

- Provide the “glue” for spell frameworks
- Handle variable parameters and specific applications
- Allow techniques to evolve and improve over time
- Perfect for experimental development and refinement

### Vows as Permanent Foundations

- Establish absolute rules for techniques (e.g., “cuts anything”)
- Create permanent sacrifices that enable maximum efficiency
- Become integral to the sorcerer's identity
- Used by masters for their most refined techniques

### Layered Implementation

Advanced techniques like [[Singularity Technique]] often use both:
- Foundation Vow establishes what was permanently sacrificed
- Implementation Contracts determine how the technique functions in specific situations

This creates a natural progression from novice to master:
- Novices rely solely on Contracts, accepting lower efficiency for safety
- Intermediates begin experimenting with more powerful but risky Contracts
- Masters anchor their most refined techniques with Vows for maximum efficiency

## VI. Case Study: The Vow of Godzilla and Mothra

Among all known Vows, none are as powerful as the one sworn between [[Godzilla, the King of the Monsters|Godzilla]] and [[Mothra, the Queen of the Monsters|Mothra]].

### Extraordinary Nature

Despite being Null, their souls are so powerful that their Vow has become essentially unbreakable due to:

- Unprecedented soul strength in both beings
- Perfect harmonic compatibility between their souls
- Divine participation through Mothra's status
- Absolute conviction from both parties
- Explicit divine invocation

### Terms and Structure

Their Vow establishes a clear division of authority:

- Godzilla rules all Titans. Mothra cannot object to his decisions on Titan affairs.
- Mothra rules human affairs. Godzilla cannot override her objections or ignore her pleas.
- 2020 Amendment: Neither can act for or against humanity unless both consent.

### Enforcement Mechanism

The Vow manifests through their verbal consent pattern:
- “I consent!” → One agrees, but the other must still decide.
- “I do not consent!” → One blocks the other from acting.
- “We consent!” → Both agree, allowing action to proceed.

### Exception Clause

If humans interfere in Titan affairs, Godzilla can punish them freely—Mothra loses her say in this specific scenario.

## VII. Commitment Mastery: Battra's Approach

As the universe's greatest sorcerer, Battra has developed the most sophisticated Commitment system in existence:

- **Complex Integrated Systems**: Hierarchical Commitments working together in harmonious patterns
- **Adaptive Frameworks**: Commitments responding dynamically to changing circumstances
- **Sacrifice Integration**: Precise alignment of magical costs with desired effects
- **Technical Integration**: Perfect synthesis of physical technique and Commitment enhancement

While the exact details of Battra's personal Commitments remain known only to him, his mastery represents the theoretical peak of what can be achieved through the perfect integration of technical skill and structured Commitments.

## VIII. Practical Applications and Methods

### Commitment Creation Process

The formation of effective Commitments follows this general sequence:

1. **Definition Phase**: Clear articulation of terms, conditions, and desired outcomes
2. **Sacrifice Determination**: Identification of appropriate trade-offs
3. **Pattern Visualization**: Mental structuring of the Commitment framework
4. **Resonance Establishment**: Creation of the soul connection (Horizontal or Vertical)
5. **Divine Acknowledgment**: Recognition and registration by Heaven
6. **Activation**: Implementation of the structured pattern

### Application Contexts

Commitments serve various practical functions in magical practice:

#### Spell Enhancement

- Increasing power, duration, or effectiveness of specific spells
- Stabilizing experimental magical techniques
- Creating consistent magical effects despite varying conditions

#### Knowledge Acquisition

- Accelerating learning in specific magical disciplines
- Securing forbidden or dangerous knowledge safely
- Preserving magical techniques across generations

#### Protection and Warding

- Creating boundaries that cannot be crossed
- Establishing consequences for specific actions
- Protecting locations, objects, or knowledge

#### Group Dynamics

- Binding communities through shared magical structures
- Creating synergistic effects between multiple practitioners
- Establishing hierarchies and responsibilities within magical organizations

## IX. Philosophical Dimensions

Beyond their practical applications, Commitments carry profound philosophical implications:

### The Connectivity Principle

[[Soul Resonance]] suggests a fundamental interconnectedness between all souls—a capacity for harmonic interaction that transcends species, magical ability, and even cosmic position. No soul is truly isolated, with even the mightiest beings participating in a web of resonance that spans the universe.

### Divine Design

The fact that Soul Resonance functions under Heaven's oversight suggests a deliberate cosmic design—one that ensures even those without conventional magical abilities retain a connection to the supernatural order. This universal access implies a cosmos designed for communication and covenant rather than isolation.

### Balance Through Complementarity

The distinction between Horizontal and Vertical pathways creates a natural balance in the magical ecosystem. Those gifted with [[Soul Infusion]] capabilities gain versatile magical potential but must work harder to create stable Commitments. Those limited to Soul Resonance may lack conventional magical options but possess a direct line to some of the most fundamental forces in the cosmos.

As Battra observes in his teachings: “The universe ensures that no soul is without voice. Those who cannot speak directly to Primus can still sing to each other, and in that harmony, even the rawest forces of creation learn to listen.”

## X. Relationship to Other Core Concepts

### Primus

- Commitments provide structure to Primus's inherent instability
- Breaking Commitments causes Primus to mutate unpredictably
- Commitment strength directly correlates with Primus stabilization effect

### Soul

- The soul serves as both catalyst and stabilizer in Commitments
- Soul strength determines Commitment potency and durability
- [[Soul Resonance]] enables Horizontal Pathway Commitments
- [[Soul Infusion]] forms the basis of the Vertical Pathway for Self-Commitments

### Null Phenomenon

- Null beings can access Mutual Commitments through [[Soul Resonance]]
- Null Commitments are often more stable due to simplified interaction
- Strong-souled Null beings can create extraordinarily powerful Mutual Commitments

### Magic Systems

- Commitments represent one pillar of the Fourfold Doctrine of Sorcery
- Commitments can enhance but cannot replace technical magical skill
- Different magical traditions emphasize varying approaches to Commitments

## Research & Development Notes

Current areas for investigation include:
- The precise mechanism by which Soul Resonance operates across dimensions
- Potential for developing hybrid Commitment structures that combine multiple types
- Methods for detecting third-party incorporation into unknown Commitments
