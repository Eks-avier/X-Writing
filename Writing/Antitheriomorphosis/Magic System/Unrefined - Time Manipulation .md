# Time Manipulation: Principles and Taboos

## Fundamental Restrictions

Time manipulation stands as one of the most severely restricted forms of magic in the universe, second only to soul manipulation in its taboo status. This prohibition stems from time's fundamental role in maintaining cosmic stability—altering it risks irrevocable damage to the timeline.

### Divine Prohibition

Heaven itself has explicitly forbidden uncontained time manipulation for several reasons:

- **Timeline Integrity**: Changes to the timestream can create cascading alterations to reality
- **Causality Protection**: Paradoxes threaten the foundational structure of existence
- **Dimensional Stability**: Time shifts can weaken barriers between parallel realities
- **Cosmic Balance**: Manipulation of time disrupts the natural flow of universal forces

Violators face consequences comparable to those who attempted soul manipulation—complete erasure from existence across all timelines.

## Conditional Exceptions

Despite these severe restrictions, limited forms of time manipulation remain possible under strictly controlled conditions. The key requirement is the complete separation of a portion of reality from the greater universe.

### Reality Separation Methods

Two primary approaches allow for safe time manipulation:

#### 1. Pocket Universe Creation

- Artificially stabilizes Primus to create a “cave” within the universe
- Requires supreme mastery of magical energy
- Functions as a completely isolated sub-reality
- Changes within cannot affect the primary universe

#### 2. Domain Barriers (“Rooms”)

- Takes an existing portion of reality and severs it via perfectly sealed barriers
- Requires unparalleled skill in barrier architecture
- Must achieve complete separation from the surrounding universe
- When reintegrated, external reality experiences no time differential

### The “Leakage” Problem

The primary concern with time manipulation is “leakage”:

- A “leaky” domain with imperfect barriers risks contaminating the greater timeline
- Even microscopic imperfections can allow changes to propagate outward
- The resulting timeline alterations are impossible to predict or control
- Cosmic enforcement is typically swift and absolute

## Practical Requirements

The extraordinary demands of safe time manipulation make it inaccessible to all but the most skilled practitioners:

### Technical Prerequisites

1. **Barrier Mastery**: Only perfect barriers can adequately contain temporal effects
2. **Energy Efficiency**: Sustaining sealed domains requires enormous magical resources
3. **Primus Stabilization**: Controlling unstable Primus during time manipulation is essential
4. **Computational Precision**: Time effects must be calculated with absolute accuracy

### Practical Limitations

Even for those with the necessary skills, significant constraints apply:

- **Duration Constraints**: Most practitioners cannot maintain sealed domains for more than seconds
- **Energy Consumption**: The magical cost increases exponentially with the size of the affected area
- **Complexity Management**: Each additional element within the domain increases calculation difficulty
- **Maintenance Focus**: Divided attention risks barrier integrity failure

## Battra's Exceptional Capacity

As the universe's greatest sorcerer, Battra possesses unique qualifications for time manipulation:

- **Barrier Architecture**: His unprecedented skill in barrier creation enables perfect seals
- **Efficiency Mastery**: Unmatched magical efficiency allows sustained domain maintenance
- **Calculation Speed**: Superior computational ability permits complex temporal calculations
- **Energy Reserves**: Vast magical resources support extended temporal operations

Despite these advantages, even Battra approaches time manipulation with extreme caution, employing it only when absolutely necessary and under carefully controlled conditions.

## Known Applications

The few viable applications of time manipulation include:

### Temporal Stasis

- Freezing objects or beings in time within a sealed domain
- Requires minimal calculation but precise barrier maintenance
- Typically limited to small volumes and short durations

### Localized Acceleration/Deceleration

- Altering the flow of time within a sealed domain
- Useful for accelerating processes or slowing attacks
- Calculation complexity increases with the degree of variance

### Event Reconstruction

- Viewing past events that occurred within a sealed domain
- Does not alter time but replays it for observation
- Lower risk but still requires perfect containment

## Modern State of Temporal Magic

The current understanding of time manipulation remains highly limited:

- Most spells were lost with their creators during divine enforcement actions
- Surviving knowledge is fragmentary and often dangerously incomplete
- New techniques must be carefully developed through first principles
- Experimentation carries extraordinary risk even for master sorcerers

This makes time manipulation one of the rarest magical practices, with most sorcerers wisely avoiding it entirely despite its potential power.
