Long, long ago in the Golden Age of Atlantis, human sorcery and technology flourished; they were being protected under the watchful gaze of the Alpha of All Titans Godzilla. The rest of humanity looked up to Atlantis as a shining beacon of knowledge and power. Nowhere on Earth could there ever be a place where technology met sorcery quite like in Atlantis. It is *the peak* of humanity, greater than even the greatest nations of the Modern Era.

But it wasn't Atlantis' fault nor even its fall that caused the disappearance of Human Sorcery. 

While Atlantis stood strong as the greatest nation on Earth now, and unexpectedly even thousands of years into the future, other human tribes existed still. To humanity, magic is merely another force of nature—it was unnatural that no one could wield it. From the Atlanteans to the primitive human tribes, magic is a fact of life.

Battra was the progenitor of the art of human sorcery. Under *his* watchful gaze did humans learned sorcery. Atlantis, most of all, benefited from his teachings, it flourished because of him. One might think that they would be an egoistic nation, they were, but even so they wielded magic and technology responsibly--their ambition was tempered by Godzilla himself and Battra as their teacher. 

Mothra on the other side of the Earth guided the psychics of Earth in her own nations and tribes. Greatest among them, almost on par with Atlantis, was the Eclipse—named lovingly after her, for she was a moth after all. Atlantis and the Eclipse enjoyed a great alliance, as all three of its wardens were great friends.

For a while this dynamic worked. Godzilla guarded and guided Atlantis, Mothra guided and guarded the Eclipse, and Battra ensured that both they knew of the best ways to use sorcery.

Even both twins were not at odds as they were today. Still, Battra's inferiority complex remained in the recesses of hid mind. He could never get over the fact that she inherited their lineage's true gift: divinity. 

The Heavenly Instance of Earth was sent from Heaven to guard the world against all evil and harm from the cosmos—it was Earth's own guardian angel, a servant of Heaven. 

When it descended, it chose the ancestors of Mothra and Battra's species. Soon after, it had a mate--an heir. Then, it *touched* the twin's ancestors. No longer were they nameless giant moth-like creatures—they were now the collectively known by the Ancient Titans of that time as the Divine Moths, not because they themselves were divine but because they were touched by actual divinity. 

However, the Heavenly Instance remained as the sole Divinity on Earth... that the Titans know of. Humans may have encountered on already while they were in the Great Sleep; nevertheless, the Titans do not know nor care. 

Eventually, the Heavenly Instance gave *itself* to its heir and passed down its soul—bonding it with the soul of its own progeny, creating the actual Divine Moth. They are the ones who hold the ultimate authority over their species. In fact, had Battra held this authority instead of his twin, it would be *Titanus battra* to Monarch, not *Titanus mosura*. The name of their species, their entire identity was at the whim of the heir to the Heavenly Instance. The family that held it was essentially the Royal Family of the Divine Moths. 

Under mysterious circumstances, their species collapsed. No one knew or why.

When Mothra and Battra emerged from their share egg, they remained as the last of their species with the former having inherited from her father the soul of the Heavenly Instance. 

From the moment of his birth, when he realized who he was with, Battra had already felt inferior. Mothra was the golden child of their species. Despite emerging first, she was the better one. The first became the last and the last became the first. It would be a silent resentment he would carry in his heart, even if he did love her still. 

Eventually, while travelling from the Eclipse to Atlantis, Battra stumbled upon a human tribe that showed great aptitude for sorcery. Never one to waste such talent, he instructed them. They learned well, they grew more curious of the world around them.

They learned of the soul, the immutable, inviolable and eternal soul within sentient mortal. All things in the universe were allowed to be bent by mortal will except for their own souls—it remained under the Heavens' discretion. Battra knows nothing more than its role in sorcery that time, he only knew of its basics and nothing more. 

Then that tribe, now lost to time and space, posed an interesting question: why should humanity's soul be tethered to a force they cannot see? Eager to learn more, they set off to unite with Atlantis and the Eclipse to further development on the soul. 

Both nations, wary for they know of the nature of the soul, agreed to help. However, this human tribe, whose name was erased—annihilated, grew ever more curious than before.

Eventually, it seemed that in all of the universe only humanity got to this point in understanding the soul. 

It was getting too dangerous. They cannot risk the judgment of the Heavens. Godzilla and Mothra have kept their eyes on them more, now more intent to figure out their goals.

The human tribe detested this. If they are willing to be tied and limited like this--at the whims of forces unseen, then they will leave Atlantis and the Eclipse.

It has become too dangerous.

For some *unknown* reason, whether by sheer luck or genius, this tribe learned how to *modify* the soul—theirs and others.

It has gotten *beyond* dangerous.

Pride and lust for power and knowledge has now filled their hearts. It was not enough, never enough. Why did the Heavens deny such power? 

They got their hands on the people of the Eclipse and one after the other the people of the Eclipse were toyed with, their souls captured, imprisoned, played with, and even destroyed. An impossibility. 

Mothra did not know what to do. She was horrified, shaken with grief and pain. Her first human friends contorted into... monstrosities unsalvageable. Their souls were too far gone now. Would they even know Heaven anymore? Would they even know the Great Void into which the vilest of souls reside? Would they know of the space between the realms where souls await their judgement?  They were *lost* now and forever. 

What have these people*done*?

And so, the Heavens said **enough**.

Powered by grief and possessed by the Heavens through the Heavenly Instance, Mothra annihilated this tribe. With a light so bright it enveloped the Earth whole, that appeared so bright alien civilizations thought they saw the saw the brightest star in their skies. The tribe perished. They would not be known in the past, present, and future. No trace of them would **ever** be found. The job of the Heavenly Instance stopped there—judgement was passed. 

But Mothra was not done yet, her grief has not been satiated yet. She decreed a Divine Mandate, the first and the only one so far on Earth, that disabled humanity's perception of Primus—forcibly turning humanity into Null. She blamed her brother, blamed him for his carelessness, blamed him for his lack of foresight, blamed him for the death of her friends, **blamed** him for ***everything***. She would take sorcery from humanity to ensure such travesty would never be done again and she would make her brother disappear from this planet for his crimes.

For some reason, Mothra poured all that grief and pain unto her brother. 

Battra was exiled, never to step foot on Earth ever again, never to even *see* Earth at all. It disappeared from his vision and senses; he could not even locate this planet no matter how hard he tried. He is left to roam the stars, and humanity is now and forevermore blind to the 5th fundamental force of nature.


Without the ability to maintain the now invisible and foreign foundation of the nation, Atlantis fell not long after. It sunk to the oceans below, fading into myth and legend.

Godzilla a couple thousand years after, who was a mere witness to this event, reflected that even after this incident--Mothra's almost childishly naive and optimistic perception towards humanity never wavered. Whether it is delusion or denial, he does not know, only that she placed the fault purely on her brother.


# Terms for the Divine Mandate Against Sorcery

## Character Terminology for the Same Historical Event

This pivotal event in the AU's history is referred to differently depending on who's discussing it, revealing character perspectives and values:

| Character/Group | Term Used | Focus/Perspective |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Battra** | **“The Severance”** | Emphasizes humanity's disconnection from Primus; clinical term focusing on consequence rather than morality |
| **Mothra** | **“The Transgression”** | Highlights the moral and divine boundary violation; carries both cosmic significance and personal grief |
| **Godzilla** | **“The Judgment”** | Direct and outcome-focused; typical of his straightforward nature and acceptance of cosmic order |
| **Keep Charlie Students** | **“The Purge”** | Blunt, dramatic shorthand typical of younger generations describing historical tragedies |
| **Monarch Researchers** | **“The Primus Dissociation Event”** | Scientific terminology that maintains academic detachment while studying the phenomenon |

## Implementation Examples

### Dialogue Opportunities

```
"We're studying The Purge in Battra's history class," Andrew mentioned casually, flipping through his notes.

Battra's eyes flashed momentarily. "You will refer to The Severance by its proper name in my presence."

Later, when Mothra visited the class, she overheard the term and gently corrected: "The Transgression was not simply about power, but about respecting boundaries that exist for all our protection."

When the students asked Godzilla about the conflicting names during his guest lecture, he simply shrugged. "The Judgment came. Names don't change what happened."

Dr. Russell's presentation to the Monarch board referred exclusively to "the Primus Dissociation Event" with academic detachment, though everyone noticed how the temperature in the room seemed to drop whenever the topic arose.
```

### Internal Narration

Different viewpoint characters can use their preferred terminology in internal monologue:

- **Battra POV**: *The Severance had been necessary, perhaps, but the punishment far exceeded the crime. Humanity shouldn't still be paying for one tribe's mistakes after all these millennia.*
- **Mothra POV**: *She still saw their faces sometimes, her first human friends from the Eclipse. The Transgression had taken them from her in ways even death couldn't have. Some boundaries were never meant to be crossed.*
- **Godzilla POV**: *The humans bickered over what to call it, but The Judgment was simple: they had violated cosmic law and paid the price. He remembered the light that day, how it had filled the sky until even he had to look away.*

## Historical Documentation

Official records could reflect the bias of their authors:

- **Keep Charlie Textbook**: *“The Purge represents the most significant supernatural intervention in human history, resulting in humanity's classification as Null for several thousand years…”*
- **Monarch Research Paper**: *“Analysis of residual energy patterns suggests the Primus Dissociation Event created a persistent psychic barrier in the human neurological system rather than actually removing the capacity for Primus interaction…”*
- **Battra's Personal Journals**: *“The Severance might have been prevented had I better understood the humans' capacity for curiosity. Their questions about the soul seemed innocent at first—how could I have known where it would lead?”*

## World-Building Function

This naming convention serves multiple narrative purposes:

1. Reveals character values and perspectives without exposition
2. Creates natural dialogue conflicts that highlight relationships
3. Establishes the significance of the event through multiple viewpoints
4. Provides hooks for gradual revelation of historical details
5. Demonstrates how history is interpreted differently based on position and power
