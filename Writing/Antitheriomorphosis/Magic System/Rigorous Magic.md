# Program Description

Rigorous Magic aims to educate you, my dearest student, about the supernatural world at large! This will be a 10 year program that will take you into a journey your entire species should have still be on (all courtesy of my lovely sister, of course)!

I warn you, child, I know you want to learn magic, but I do not mean to simply teach you mere party tricks. I will teach you how to make the world around you bend towards your will. The magic I will teach you will allow you to shape reality as you see fit. Due to that, I require that you put everything you have. You will cry, you will get hurt many times (most of the times by your own spells backfiring), and you will be tested by things so far beyond your comprehension and capability. Of course, you will have the option to stop if you cannot handle it any longer, but I cannot say if Gojira can hold off my sister enough again to give us another try at this. So, **treat this as if it is your only shot at magic**.

At the end of this program, I will give you the option to learn one of the *Big 3 of Magic*. They are far beyond you for now, but you will get to know them as you go. Do not worry about your age at that point, for if you pass this program, I'm sure even Gojira will see the talent in you and put down his foot on my sister's protests, which is to say we three will keep you alive for as long as you require it ;)

This program is sponsored by Monarch and Gojira, so please give them your thanks before we start our classes, most especially to our dearest king. I'm sure he had to endure my sister's incessant howling, nagging and protesting in both the physical and mental plane just to give us this chance; so please, do me a favour and render unto him your highest of gratitudes.

Signed, your new favorite teacher and the greatest sorcerer, Battra.

P.S: Worry not about this letter getting damaged, it cannot be torn so easily!

## Year 1

Welcome to the world of magic, my student!

Once we begin, I promise that you will never experience life the same way ever again!

For this year, our goal is to start slow and end strong.

We will start slow because it is at *this* exact stage that the greatest of magicians are born. Often in other civilizations beyond ours here, they have a tendency to skip to the “good parts”, as they say; these are the flashiest, the prettiest, and the most developed parts of Magic.

They will be taught how to move earth with their minds, fly at their own leisure, crush the innards of a living creature, and even, yet pretentiously and ineffectively, curve the fabric of space and time

We will **not** begin with that. We will **not** tarnish the act of learning Magic with such filthy methods.

And thus we begin slow. I shall forge into you an unshakeable foundation in Magic. No explosions will be made, neither floating things, nor giant gaping chasms in the fabric of space. Rather, we will think and meditate and play around the substrata that makes Magic, well, Magic.

Beyond such theoretical drabble, we also will find your center, the *être de raison* of your desire to learn these supernatural arts, and bring them out front and center. Mindset is such an important foundation for sorcery; it is in fact a lifestyle.

These foreign civilizations treat it as nothing but a mere subject to learn. This is what I thought as well, until I met the ancient human sorcerers, that is. Only then did I realize that magic for us mortals is a way of life. *How you think shapes how you live*, is that not correct? Then with Magic, *how you think will shape the world around you*. So many a practician of these arts have turned awry and amiss… ***Deeply*** do I regret not seeing those in my own students long long ago.

My biggest fear is… is that which I cannot ***name*** no more, but that which I seek to avoid from happening once more until the end of time.

And so, when we end this year, we will not just have found the core of magic itself, but yours as well; **that** is what I mean by finishing strong.

These are our goals, dearest student and I sincerely hope that we achieve them in a timely manner.

Welcome once again! I do hope you enjoy this, as they say, chill year! :D

P.S: Physical conditioning is an important thing! One thing I have observed from the ancient prodigies of sorcery is that their bodies are **tough**! Built to last. Think of it this way, to be able to do more, your body must ***be*** more. (Plus you'll live longer, I hate to outlive you so soon after all…)

## Year 2

*Her* presence was palpable, even when she had stood at the **HEAV** bay on the way to Castle Bravo, a voice in her head had informed Sierra of *her* presence.

Stella had always fashioned *her* as rays of morning light seeping through the blinders of a dark room—gradual, teasing, yet inevitable all the same.

*Tila bang nabubuhay 'yong kaluluwa ko tuwing nararamdaman ko siya*.

But she could never feel the same way, and not ever now that she had begun her training under Battra.

“The mystic arts are not powered by the ambient energy surrounding us, not by any of its variants, nor by its root, but rather here, ” he said, pointing at her chest.

Even when stuck in the dark, lifeless chambers of Castle Bravo where mechanical whirring of machines she could not even begin to comprehend fill the halls, she hears her new master's words.

“The heart,” she remembers replying to that.

“The soul.”

He puts out a hand, and from it came forth ribbons of light in every colour her eyes have known and will ever know.

“Without it, no magic can be used; it is the fire in the furnace of the mystic arts, Sierra, ” he had stressed.

“Then why does *she* **hate** you so much for it?”

That look in her master's face will always haunt her from then on. Such despair had darkened even her soul.

*Si OA ka ba?*

Curiously, she wondered if such *despair* could manifest in *her* face, or even yet, in *his*. But she shoots that thought down. It was impossible, she mused, for those *two* truly do seem to be above it all.

*“Her ill tidings with me are not due to magic alone, but rather something… more personal”

Suddenly, the uneasy feeling returns, yet now it overwhelms her. For but a mere moment, her eyes darken, her body shivers, and all her hair stood on end.

But such terrors were dispelled as soon as it had come when she felt impossibly soft, smooth, and dainty fingers land on her shoulders.

“Sierra, my dear. You must not enter here.”

She feels herself be brought back down to Earth and whips her head to the sign above them.

**DANGER! RADIOACTIVE WASTE!**

“Ah puta, ba't naman kasi andito 'to?”

The woman behind her had the most beautiful eyes that she has ever seen. The woman laughs. It takes Sierra a minute to gather all of it for they were looking at her—the color of sapphires that she could only see in those *sosyal na malls*. Even the sound of her laugh was a near-impossibility as well; as if a thousand bells manifested in the hall they were on, their soft tinkles somehow giving birth to life within this section of the facility

“You must've been so distracted to have missed the three alarms going off when you entered the room, ” *she* had said as she fiercely fends off the mirth escaping *her*.

“Quite a lot in your mind?”

“Why don't you just read it?”

“And invade your privacy? Would that not be scandalous, yes?”

## Year 5

Greatest of joys be upon me! You have finally reached half this program's length. And my, you certainly have grown. Look at this collage I made for you, my dear! You used to look so little, my; little child and little spells, you humans certainly do grow up too fast.

I hope you have understood why I was not offering you any new specializations this summer and have prepared for this new year succinctly, my student, for we will now be dedicating this year to getting you to develop your own technique! You remember in our intro course? Think of it as your own toolbox of artifacts, spells, and tokens that are uniquely, *uniquely*, ***uniquely*** yours!

Furthermore, your excellence in practical sorcery had not escaped my eye, child. Due to that, I have placed a few exercises that will be sure to stimulate your big brain of yours :D

However, your practical sorcery does not match your utter brilliance in alchemy and optimization. In fact, it has filled me with so much glee that we're making the next optimization courses **harder***. My child, certainly I have been correct in my prior assessment 5 years ago that you possess a talent I have not seen since the Golden Age of Altantean Sorcery. In fact, your ability to optimize spells have impressed even my little sister! I fear it is not long before you make her turn over into a new leaf in her views towards magic… * \\ o / *

But it has not escaped my eye that your history courses have been lagging behind slightly, *again*. Part of sorcery is multi-tasking, remember? You are no longer bound by human limitations! So work it harder student! Moreover, surely, you will find our set of history courses this year to be more exciting than the rest! ;D

More seriously, my child… If you reach the end of this year with your stellar performance, you would have surpassed most foreign worlds in terms of sorcery! Just writing this feels me with so much anticipation and glee, my dearest! If you ***pass*** that is :)

Notice in this year's curriculum that, during your first semester along with your new set of courses, is a new never before seen course!

Do you know why you have to prepare for this exam specifically, my most lovely student?

***Your final exam for this year is against me***.

A practical combat exam against me where you will have a set of objectives to accomplish; what are those OBJs you ask yourself? It's an utmost secret don't bother knowing! >:DDD

Right here and now, as you read this letter and reach this part, you may choose to partake in this optional Vow.

***Land one single spell on me, may it be whatever you want.***

***Should you succeed, your instruction will reduce by a year and we will begin your training with one of the Big 3 as soon as your 8th year. Fail and I extend your years by 5 more.***

Once you have signed, you may no longer back out.

May you have another excellent year, my dearest student! My pride in you is absolute and supreme, that is for certain.

Signed, your coolest professor ever and the greatest sorcerer, Battra.

P.S: Gojira will be instructing you in your Physical Conditioning, have fun! :D
