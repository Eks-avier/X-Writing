# Barriers, Domains, and Pocket Universes

## Fundamental Concepts

The separation of space from the greater universe represents a distinct magical discipline with applications ranging from simple protection to complex reality manipulation. While often associated with defensive magic, spatial separation arts exist as their own specialized field.

### Three Levels of Spatial Separation

Spatial separation magic exists on a spectrum of complexity and completeness:

#### 1. Barriers

- **Definition**: Energetic constructs that block or filter specific elements
- **Structure**: Single or multi-layered protective fields
- **Connection**: Remain fully connected to primary reality
- **Application**: Protection, containment, filtration

#### 2. Domains (“Rooms”)

- **Definition**: Sections of reality severed from the greater universe
- **Structure**: Precisely defined areas enclosed by perfect barriers
- **Connection**: Temporarily disconnected but retaining location
- **Application**: Controlled environments, fight containment, specialized magic

#### 3. Pocket Universes

- **Definition**: Artificial sub-realities with independent physical laws
- **Structure**: Complete realities with customizable properties
- **Connection**: Entirely separate from main universe except at anchor points
- **Application**: Storage, habitation, long-term projects

## Barrier Architecture

### Basic Properties

Barriers represent the most fundamental level of spatial separation:

- **Energy Composition**: Created from stabilized Primus formed into structured patterns
- **Permeability**: Can be designed to block specific energies, matter, or beings
- **Visibility**: Range from completely invisible to elaborately visible based on design
- **Duration**: May be temporary (seconds) or semi-permanent (years)

### Advanced Barrier Types

Masters of barrier magic can create sophisticated variations:

- **Prismatic Barriers**: Multi-layered protection with each layer blocking different energy types
- **Adaptive Barriers**: Self-modifying in response to attacks
- **Reflective Barriers**: Return energies to their source
- **Selective Barriers**: Allow certain entities passage while blocking others

Though these variations have defensive purposes, they still fulfill the notion of separating space.

## Domain Creation (“Room” Construction)

### Technical Requirements

Domains represent a significant advancement in spatial separation:

- **Perfect Sealing**: No connection to outside universe can remain
- **Energy Sustainment**: Requires continuous power to maintain separation
- **Boundary Precision**: Must have exact dimensions and properties
- **Reintegration Mechanism**: Method to safely return the domain to normal space

### Domain Applications

Properly constructed domains enable several magical practices:

- **Fight Containment**: Preventing collateral damage from magical conflicts
- **Controlled Conditions**: Creating ideal environments for specific spells
- **Safe Experimentation**: Testing dangerous magic without external risk
- **Conditional Magic**: Performing magic that requires specialized environments

### Time Manipulation Requirement

The most significant application of domains is enabling safe time manipulation:

- Only within perfectly sealed domains can time be altered without cosmic consequences
- The domain must completely sever all connections to the greater timeline
- Even microscopic imperfections can cause “leakage” of temporal effects
- Duration limitations make extended time manipulation extraordinarily difficult

## Pocket Universe Construction

### Creation Process

Pocket universes represent the highest level of spatial separation magic:

- **Primus Stabilization**: Creating a foundation of artificially stabilized Primus
- **Reality Framework**: Establishing basic physical laws and constants
- **Dimensional Anchoring**: Creating connection points to the main universe
- **Environmental Definition**: Developing the internal environment and features

### Distinctive Properties

Unlike simpler spatial constructs, pocket universes possess unique characteristics:

- **Law Customization**: Physical laws can be adjusted from main universe
- **Temporal Independence**: Time may flow differently than in main reality
- **Spatial Expansion**: Interior dimensions can exceed apparent exterior size
- **Persistent Existence**: Continue existing without continuous maintenance

### Notable Applications

Pocket universes serve various specialized functions:

- **Keep Charlie**: Educational facility inside Castle Bravo
- **Battra's Tree of Magic**: Spell storage system within a pocket dimension
- **Artifact Containment**: Housing dangerous magical items safely
- **Private Residence**: Living spaces for beings with specific requirements

## Battra as Master of Spatial Separation

As the greatest sorcerer in the universe, Battra has unparalleled mastery of spatial separation magic:

### Barrier Expertise

- Can create perfect seals that prevent any form of leakage
- Develops barriers with unprecedented complexity and efficiency
- Maintains multiple barrier systems simultaneously without degradation

### Domain Manipulation

- Creates combat domains that perfectly contain devastation
- Sustains domains longer than any other practitioner
- Designs specialized domains for specific magical applications

### Pocket Universe Mastery

- Has created numerous pocket universes for various purposes
- Sacrificed one to create Keep Charlie educational facility
- Maintains complex systems like the Tree of Magic within custom dimensions

## Magical Classification Distinction

It's important to note that spatial separation magic exists as its own discipline:

- **Not Protective Magic**: Though often used defensively, it's a distinct field
- **Not Dimensional Magic**: Focuses on manipulating existing space, not traversing dimensions
- **Not Transportation Magic**: Though pocket universes facilitate storage, that's a byproduct

For magical taxonomists, spatial separation represents a specialized application of Primus manipulation focusing on the boundary conditions between defined spaces.
