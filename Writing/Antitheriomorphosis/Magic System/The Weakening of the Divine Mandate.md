# The Weakening of the [[Divine Mandate Against Sorcery|Divine Mandate]]

- Heaven “pours power and weight” into Mandates, but the Divine Instance must continually enforce them
- During a period where Mothra was disconnected from her divine powers, enforcement temporarily ceased
- When her power returned, she did not actively *re*inforce the Mandate, allowing human magic to persist
- Mothra's original implementation was driven by emotion rather than complete understanding
