# The Weakening of the [[Divine Mandate Against Sorcery|Divine Mandate]]

- Heaven “pours power and weight” into Mandates, but the Divine Instance must continually enforce them
- During a period where Mothra was disconnected from her divine powers, enforcement temporarily ceased
- When her power returned, she did not actively *re*inforce the Mandate, allowing human magic to persist
	- However, no new humans capable of magic will be born or awakened
		- Thus, all the humans who could already perform magic thanks to the weakening remain capable of using it; no new sorcerers may be born once Mothra's powers returned.
- Mothra's original implementation was driven by emotion rather than complete understanding
