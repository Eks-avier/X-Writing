# The Art of Commitments

Commitments represent one pillar of the Fourfold Doctrine of Sorcery, alongside the [[Art of Spell Casting]], the [[Art of Spell Optimization]], and the [[Art of Spell Keeping]]. While not the foundation of magic itself, Commitments are powerful structures that interact with [[Primus]], the 5th fundamental force of nature. Once thought to be exclusive to sorcerers, it was later discovered that even those who are [[The Null|Null]] may be able to invoke certain types of Commitments if they possess an indomitable soul.

## I. The Nature of Commitments

Commitments function as structured abstractions over Primus, which is inherently unstable and seeks transformation. They shape and stabilize Primus, creating predictable magical patterns. If a Commitment is broken, Primus mutates unpredictably—often leading to catastrophic consequences.

Commitments are powerful tools, but they come at a cost. They require specific, concrete sacrifices that affect the practitioner's life, abilities, or well-being. These physical, emotional, or mental trade-offs are necessary for any Commitment to function. In extreme cases, giving up one's life can serve as a valid and enormously powerful trade-off.

### Soul Resonance: The Foundation of Commitments

All Commitments operate through Soul Resonance - the harmonic interaction between souls that creates patterns affecting Primus. This mechanism explains how both magical practitioners and Null beings can participate in certain types of Commitments:

- **Horizontal Pathway (Soul-to-Soul)**: Direct resonance between two or more souls, with Heaven serving as witness and enforcer. This pathway is available to all beings with souls, including Null species.
- **Vertical Pathway (Soul-to-Primus)**: Direct soul manipulation of Primus through Soul Infusion. This pathway is limited to beings capable of magical practice.

### Implicit vs. Explicit Commitments

Commitments can be either explicitly formed through conscious intent or implicitly created through magical practice:

- **Explicit Commitments**: Consciously established agreements with clearly defined terms and consequences.
- **Implicit Commitments**: Unconsciously formed through magical practices like incantations and gestures, where the practitioner trades effort for magical effect without necessarily recognizing the underlying Commitment structure.

## II. The Two Categories of Commitments

Commitments fall into two fundamental categories based on how they operate:

### 1. Self-Commitments

_Requires both Soul Infusion and Soul Resonance, inaccessible to Null beings_

These are personal commitments made by an individual that shape their own magical practice:

|Commitment Type|Punishment for Breaking|
|---|---|
|Contracts|Loss of bonus effect or enhancement|
|Promises|Temporary curse|
|Oaths|Loss of identity & power|
|Vows|Permanent curse, proportional to soul strength|
|Covenants|None (cannot be broken)|

### 2. Mutual Commitments

_Requires at least the capability of Soul Resonance, some accessible to Null beings_

These involve commitments between two or more individuals, with Heaven serving as witness:

|Commitment Type|Punishment for Breaking|
|---|---|
|Contracts|As dictated by contract terms|
|Promises|Permanent curse|
|Oaths|Collective loss of identity and power|
|Vows|Guaranteed, unpredictable death|
|Covenants|Impossible to break (divine agreement)|

### Comprehensive Commitment Comparison

|Commitment Type|Self-Commitment|Mutual Commitment|Unique Trait|Null Access|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Contracts|Technical, specific|Transactional|Logical, precise|No (requires Soul Infusion in both cases)|
|Promises|Belief-based|Conviction-bound|Based on belief|Yes (through Soul Resonance)|
|Oaths|Identity-aligned|Group-binding|Binds identity and duty|Yes (through Soul Resonance)|
|Vows|Soul-bound|Death-enforced|Personal, eternal|Yes (through Soul Resonance)|
|Covenants|Divine-granted|Divine-witnessed|Divine authority|Yes (through Soul Resonance)|

## III. The Five Commitments in Detail

### 1. Contracts – A Sorcerer's Best Friend

Contracts are the most common and flexible Commitment, serving as essential tools in sorcery.

- Contracts shape and stabilize Primus, acting like a structured spell-enhancement framework.
- Mutual Contracts are transactional—if one party fails, they suffer the agreed-upon consequence.
- Self-Contracts create frameworks that can enhance specific aspects of spellcasting.
- Breaking a Contract collapses the structured magic instantly, like a toppled Jenga tower.
- Contracts can stabilize experimental spells, but only the known portions—leaving unknown elements unpredictable.
- Conflicting Contracts interact sequentially, like buffs and debuffs in a MOBA game.
- Contracts can be layered, but reckless layering can destabilize magic and harm the user.
- **Null Access**: Inaccessible to Null beings as they require direct Primus manipulation through Soul Infusion to establish conditional logic, even for Mutual Contracts.

#### Specialized Contract Application

In spell optimization, different forms of Contracts provide unique advantages:

- **Targeted Enhancement**: Can improve specific spell elements (typically 20-50% improvement)
- **Activation Conditions**: Function under clearly defined circumstances or actions
- **Duration**: Temporary, lasting until contract conditions expire
- **Required Sacrifice**: Must involve concrete trade-offs related to the enhancement sought

#### Implicit Contracts in Spellcasting

Incantations and gestures function as implicit Contracts between the caster and their spell:

- Full incantations with complete gestures represent the maximum “investment” and yield the highest magical output.
- Chants with partial gestures offer reduced casting time at the cost of reduced effect.
- Silent casting with minimal gestures provides convenience but significantly reduces power.

This proportional relationship between effort and effect operates as an implicit Contract regardless of whether the sorcerer recognizes it as such.

### 2. Promises – The Power of Conviction

Promises are unique because they do not rely on magical ability, but on sheer belief.

- Anyone can make a Promise, including Null individuals with Soul Resonance capability.
- Breaking a Promise always results in a Curse on the promiser.
- The severity of the Curse depends on the strength of the broken Promise.
- Null individuals are completely vulnerable to Curses from Broken Promises.
- A Null's Promise can unintentionally generate magic if their conviction is absolute.
- While rare, a Null's Promise can last for generations, but only if they are long-lived or immortal.
- Sorcerers are wary of Nulls making Promises—not because they always cause magic, but because the Null themselves is terrifying if fully committed.
- **Null Access**: Accessible to Null beings through the Horizontal Pathway of Soul Resonance.

#### Promise Applications in Magic

In magical practice, Promises can create:

- General enhancement across related spell categories (typically 10-25% improvement)
- Consistent patterns that support magical practice
- Frameworks active as long as promise conditions are maintained
- Required Sacrifice: Behavioral patterns or consistent practice involving genuine effort or restriction

### 3. Oaths – Binding Duty and Identity

Oaths are Commitments of allegiance, sworn duty, and identity. Unlike Promises, which are personal, and Vows, which are soul-bound, Oaths connect individuals to a larger cause, group, or purpose.

- Breaking an Oath results in Oathbreaker Status—disabling magic and the ability to make new Commitments.
- Mutual Oaths, when broken, erase the group's collective legacy and power.
- Oathbreaker status can only be removed by:
    - A master sorcerer, often requiring a Vow in return.
    - Genuine redemption—if the Oathbreaker attempts to fulfill their Oath in earnest.
- Different cultures punish Oathbreakers with exile, death, or ritual cleansing.
- **Null Access**: For Self-Oaths, inaccessible to Null beings as they require Soul Infusion. For Mutual Oaths, accessible to Null beings through Soul Resonance.

#### Oath Applications in Magic

For sorcerers, Oaths can provide:

- Broad enhancement across entire magical disciplines (typically 40-80% improvement)
- Integration of magical practice with core identity elements
- Long-term frameworks often spanning decades
- Required Sacrifice: Identity alignment with sworn purpose, restricting personal freedom

### 4. Vows – The Ultimate Personal Commitment

Vows are the strongest personal Commitments, directly tied to the soul.

- Vows persist beyond death—unlike other Commitments.
- Breaking a Vow results in random, often ironic, punishments decided by the Heavens.
- The only certainty is that breaking a Mutual Vow results in death.
- For personal Vows, breaking one results in a Curse—scaled in severity based on the strength of the Vow.
- The unpredictability of punishment makes Vows terrifying—there is no fairness, only fate.
- **Null Access**: Self-Vows are inaccessible to Null beings as they require Soul Infusion. Mutual Vows are accessible to Null beings with sufficient soul strength through Soul Resonance, requiring explicit divine invocation with absolute conviction.

#### Vow Applications in Magic

At the highest level, Vows can create:

- Comprehensive enhancement of entire magical practice (typically 75-120% improvement)
- Frameworks requiring absolute dedication to vowed purpose
- Permanent effects lasting until death or beyond
- Required Sacrifice: Extraordinary commitments potentially affecting survival itself

### 5. Covenants – The Divine Agreement

Covenants are the strongest and rarest type of Commitment, formed only between a Mortal and a Divine.

- Covenants cannot be broken—attempting to do so results in ultimate damnation.
- Only known Covenant: Titanus Mosura traded magic for immortality.
- **Null Access**: While Null beings cannot initiate Self-Covenants (requiring Soul Infusion), they can participate in Mutual Covenants through Soul Resonance if established by divine beings.

## IV. Commitments in Magical Development

The relationship between technical practice and Commitment-based enhancement creates a layered approach to magical development:

### Foundation: Technical Mastery Through Practice

Before Commitments can meaningfully enhance spellcasting, sorcerers must establish solid technical foundations:

- **Physical Training**: Mastery of gestures and movements
- **Vocal Training**: Perfection of verbal components
- **Visualization Practice**: Development of mental imagery
- **Energy Control**: Basic manipulation of Structured Primus

This technical foundation provides the framework upon which Commitment-based enhancement can build. Without it, even the strongest Commitments cannot compensate for fundamental execution flaws.

### Enhancement: Structured Frameworks Through Commitments

Once technical foundations are established, Commitments can create structured frameworks for enhancement:

- **Specific Improvements**: Targeted enhancement of particular magical elements
- **Consistent Patterns**: Frameworks for reliable magical performance
- **Integration Systems**: Approaches that unify different magical techniques
- **Adaptive Capabilities**: Frameworks that respond to changing circumstances

### Progression Path

A sorcerer's typical development path with Commitments follows this pattern:

1. **Beginner Phase**: Focus on technical foundations with minimal Commitment use
2. **Intermediate Phase**: Introduction of simple Contracts and Promises to address specific weaknesses
3. **Advanced Phase**: Development of sophisticated Oaths that align magical practice with identity
4. **Master Phase**: Creation of carefully structured Vows that provide comprehensive enhancement

At each stage, the sacrifices required for Commitments become more significant, but so do the potential enhancements.

## V. The Role of Primus in Commitments

- Primus is the 5th fundamental force of nature, inherently unstable and seeking transformation.
- Commitments act as structured frameworks that shape and stabilize Primus into magic.
- When a Commitment is broken, Primus mutates unpredictably—causing Curses, magical loss, or death.
- Commitments are not the source of magic itself, but rather tools that interact with and enhance the soul's natural ability to structure Primus.
- Battra, the Lord of the Mystic Arts, is the only being known to wield raw Primus, as he alone understands why it transforms upon contact with a soul.

## VI. Legendary Vows – Godzilla and Mothra

Among all known Vows, none are as powerful as the one sworn between Godzilla and Mothra.

- Despite being Null, their souls are so powerful that their Vow has become essentially unbreakable.
- This extraordinary strength stems from:
    - Unprecedented soul strength in both beings
    - Perfect harmonic compatibility between their souls
    - Divine participation through Mothra's status
    - Absolute conviction from both parties
    - Explicit divine invocation
- Terms of Their Vow:
    - Godzilla rules all Titans. Mothra cannot object to his decisions on Titan affairs.
    - Mothra rules human affairs. Godzilla cannot override her objections or ignore her pleas.
    - 2020 Amendment: Neither can act for or against humanity unless both consent.
- How Others View Their Vow:
    - Titans: Godzilla enforces his rule as the singular Alpha, while Mothra ignores Titan politics, making her unpopular among lesser Titans.
    - Humans: Frustrated—because neither can act for or against them without the other's consent.
    - Expression of the Vow:
        - “I consent!” → One agrees, but the other must still decide.
        - “I do not consent!” → One blocks the other from acting.
        - “We consent!” → Both agree, allowing action to proceed.
    - Exception: If humans interfere in Titan affairs, Godzilla can punish them freely—Mothra loses her say.

## VII. Third-Party Involvement in Commitments

Individuals can become unwittingly incorporated into Mutual Commitments without their knowledge or consent. When this occurs:

- The third party becomes part of the magical contract's structure without awareness
- They typically receive no benefits from the Commitment
- They may be affected by the consequences if the Commitment is broken
- They have no ability to influence or end the Commitment

This possibility makes Commitments particularly dangerous in social contexts, as individuals may be incorporated into magical agreements without their knowledge.

## VIII. Battra's Mastery of Commitments

As the universe's greatest sorcerer, Battra has developed the most sophisticated Commitment system in existence. His approach demonstrates what is theoretically possible with sufficient skill and sacrifice:

- **Complex Integrated Systems**: Hierarchical Commitments that work together in harmonious patterns
- **Adaptive Frameworks**: Commitments that respond dynamically to changing circumstances
- **Sacrifice Integration**: Precise alignment of magical costs with desired effects
- **Technical Integration**: Perfect synthesis of physical technique and Commitment enhancement

While the exact details of Battra's personal Commitments remain known only to him, the results are evident in his unparalleled magical capabilities. His mastery represents the theoretical peak of what can be achieved through the perfect integration of technical skill and structured Commitments.

## IX. Philosophical Dimensions

Beyond their practical applications, Commitments carry profound philosophical implications:

### The Connectivity Principle

Soul Resonance suggests a fundamental interconnectedness between all souls—a capacity for harmonic interaction that transcends species, magical ability, and even cosmic position. No soul is truly isolated, with even the mightiest beings participating in a web of resonance that spans the universe.

### Divine Design

The fact that Soul Resonance functions under Heaven's oversight suggests a deliberate cosmic design—one that ensures even those without conventional magical abilities retain a connection to the supernatural order. This universal access implies a cosmos designed for communication and covenant rather than isolation.

### Balance Through Complementarity

The distinction between Horizontal and Vertical pathways creates a natural balance in the magical ecosystem. Those gifted with Soul Infusion capabilities gain versatile magical potential but must work harder to create stable Commitments. Those limited to Soul Resonance may lack conventional magical options but possess a direct line to some of the most fundamental forces in the cosmos.

As Battra observes in his teachings: “The universe ensures that no soul is without voice. Those who cannot speak directly to Primus can still sing to each other, and in that harmony, even the rawest forces of creation learn to listen.”
