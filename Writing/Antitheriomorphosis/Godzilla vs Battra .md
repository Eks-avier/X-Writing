# Godzilla Vs Battra

## Prelude

- After defeating most of the Wardens and Betas in Antarctica all at once, Battra moves to the next phase of his plan: fighting his twin sister. 
	- Anguirus
	- Rodan
	- Kong
	- Leviathan
	- Scylla
	- Manda 
	- Bakunawa
	- Baragon
- Battra evaluates post-battle; he realizes just how strong the Titans of Earth really are... No, the humans are engaging with the Xillien and holding on. Earth is amazing.
- He's compelled to kill the downed Titans but... he senses his twin.
- With haste, Battra opens a portal to New York City
- New York is a ghost of itself, the city completely empty. All the civilians have been evacuated prior to the beginning of the invasion, as it has been predicted.
- Godzilla stands atop a random building, holding a small pouch, woven with the silk of the Queen of Titans. It holds a considerable amount of her scales. On the palm of his hands, thrumming with energy, the scales glow with a bright electric blue. To deceive those who would seek them both, they devised a way to mimic each other's energy signatures. For Godzilla, Mothra needs some of his scales, which in this case is a bagful of his hair. For Mothra, Godzilla also needs some her scales, which in this case are the glittering golden dust, often invisible out of combat, swirling around her. 
- The enemy should be here any minute, and he should fall for the bait, Godzilla throws the pouch several kilometers away. He sees it land on top of a building. That should be enough distance.
- Monarch, through a drone, receives this signal. From far away, on the island in the Pacific known as Monster Island, they begin charging the massive energy cannon aimed at the mothership hovering over the Earth. This spectacle masks Godzilla's energy as all the sensors of the mothership and its invading ships pull its attention from Godzilla and to the energy cannon. 
- The energy cannon was modeled after him and his atomic breath, but to enhance the range and power, it compresses the energy, turning it akin to a laser. But during its period of creation several months back, a thought sprang to Godzilla's mind. He needs to be a step ahead, and if it were possible that humans can build a machine like that by mimicking him, then doing the same should be no big deal.
- Godzilla begins charging up as well. He envisioned it in his mind. The energy cannon that Monarch will use, he models it in his head. He concentrates the energy in his finger tip. A ball of energy swirls on his forefinger, the immense pressure it is creating slowly chips away at the building he is standing on, and the area around him too. He imagines folding the energy again and again; compress it; crush it. Finally, release.
- A portal over New York opens. Black, ominous, and seemingly drowned in shadows, it rips open space as if it were paper. Runes adorn its edges, seemingly holding the portal open.
- Battra slides through the portal, and looks to the above. A bright light glimmers up above. The mothership! But how?
- But before he could do anything, his senses picked up danger coming from the left, and in the span of less than a second, a sizable portion of the city around his position has been annihilated. The shockwave thunders through the city blocks, shattering everything it comes across with.
- Even rubble was not spared, and Battra opens his eyes to a clear sky, the clouds parted. A beam of energy fired from someplace else travelling towards the mothership. Then, immense pain shot through his body. 
- Battra has lost two hands. He had reacted instinctually in that moment, fortifying the perpetual barrier surrounding him with more of his energy and his own scales, the glittering purple dust shifting around him. But it wasn't enough. 
- Attempting to recover, Battra suddenly felt drowned, as if he was slowly suffocating under the weight of something. Recovering seems to be an immense chore. *He was being forced downward, to bow*. This pressure, he knows it. The fear that is woven into the heart of every Titan for 250 million Earth years. Despite his exile from his Home, Earth, he knows this suffocating pressure, the weight of an entire ocean in his lungs, no--the weight of a *star* on his head. This is the King of the Titans. This… this was his old friend: Godzilla.
- The aura of his power **erupts**, covering the entire city in nothing but *him*. It shattered the glass in the buildings beside him, it cracked the asphalt on his foot, it blew away vehicles. 
- From space, the Xilliens did not need their scanners to see what has happened. Their benefactor has engaged with the invasion's biggest obstacle.
- In the Monarch Headquarters, awe filled the room. This is Godzilla's full power being unshackled--post-Antitheriomorphosis. 
	- Dr. Rick Stanton immediately took note of the that pencil-thin beam that Godzilla just shot out. *A new ability besides his Atomic Amplification?!*
	- On their monitors, many lower-ranked Titans and nation militaries worked hand-in-hand to defend.
	- An operation to retrieve the knocked out Titan Wardens and Betas in the Antarctic were initiated ASAP.
- Godzilla urges to fight Battra, even though a prickling feeling in his gut told likely for him to get outmatched. 
	- Before this invasion had begun. His intuition told him that something will go wrong if Mothra takes the fight instead. Not to mention that she has a bigger grudge on Gigan. He's always known that, and it would be better for herself that she dealt with the alien cyborg first.
- *Godzilla doesn't know it yet, but Battra possesses a sealing spell capable of sealing Heavenly Instances. His unexpected call to fight Battra in Mothra's stead was right, but he would be unaware of it until later.*
- Battra, incapacitated by Godzilla's crushing presence, teleports away. Anywhere, somewhere safe. In a snap, he appears inside of an office building, away from him.

## Phase 1

- Battra, armless, summons shadow clones of the Titans he fought in the Antarctic
- This act should buy enough time for the energy crackling around his arms to dissipate. Once it does, he can regenerate his arms.
- Godzilla, with his improved physical prowess powered by his Amplification, made quick work.
- One by one each shadow fell, quicker than anticipated.
- Fearing his discovery, Battra pushed through his healing anyway--using any spell that can remake his arms. 
- By the time Godzilla took out Rodan and Anguirus' clones, his arms were remade--shabby, but he can heal them as the time goes on.

## Phase 2

- Battra constructs a Self-Contract. He can only use 10 specific Techniques, but he may not use his millions of other spells. In exchange, he gains a 150% increase on those 10 Techniques. 
- He tests how each one works on Godzilla.

## Phase 2.5

- Battra refuses to kill Godzilla, even though he is fully capable of doing so. Instead he wants to seal him too. 
- Battra acknowledges that he feels… something… for Godzilla. He doesn't want to kill him, he subconsciously can't even perform at his peak. He knows that Godzilla had done nothing wrong to him. He wasn't the one that exiled him, and even the Invaders he has allied with knows just how much of an asset he could be. 
- This prevents Battra from doing anything utterly lethal. He decides that it is better to seal him away, much like what he wants to do with his sister.
- This is the most crucial mistake. To seal Godzilla, he has to incapacitate him. But who can withstand his sorcery better than him? He adapts and evolves throughout the fight. Spells that harmed him at first began to lose effectiveness.
- The entire fight, Battra simply wants to seal him. But, he can't put him down long enough for the seal to kick in. He regenerates too fast, his energy interferes with his spells too much, he's now dodging things rather than taking them head on, extremely uncharacteristic of him. He's getting too much to handle.
- As the fight rages on, it becomes apparent that the gap between them is closing extremely quickly.
- He tries for his first trump card. The technique he had used to defeat all the other Kaiju. 
- Clasping his hands, a black mass engulfs them both. From the outside, it formed as a sphere of pure black. 
- Within, Battra put forward his arm and out came forth from the pitch black innumerable energy balls, their glow providing illumination within the dark space around them.
- The energy balls scattered around Godzilla before he could even react. Then, with another command from Battra, blasts rained down on him. 
- It tore his clothes apart, his skin going off with them. It punched holes through his body; it cut some of his fingers off. But, he's regenerating and it's what's keeping him alive. 
- Battra notices this and could not help but wonder when did his regeneration become so fast. Without wasting anytime, he prepares the seal with an incantation.
- While Godzilla stands there getting torn to shreds, Battra begins the seal on the defending man's feet. Chains of black creeped up from the darkness below them and found its way to Godzilla.
- But this would not last. With a flash of blue light, a nuclear pulse was emanated from around Godzilla, destroying the energy balls and the chains.
- Battra smirks and simply swipes a hand forward and the bombardment and seal returned just as quickly.
- But again, Godzilla uses his Nuclear Pulse and dispelled it. 
- And again, Battra returned them. He thinks he has already won.
- But Godzilla was eyeing him closely. The electric blue eyes shimmering as he was being pelted. He notices the pitch black space around them, he sees the way the energy swirls around Battra as he commands it with his sorcery. Something here should be the key to free him from this torture.
- From the outside, the black spherical object floating in New York caught Monarch's attention. The prior blast strikes true on the mothership, but the shields were seemingly too strong, the weapon is now recharging and they need to get rid of the mass of invaders swarming the island. 
- One scientist takes note of this and muses if it is what he thinks it is, to which another simply watches in horror.
- Approximately 5 minutes after the sphere was constructed, it shattered and our two combatants were flung across opposite directions.
- Godzilla, bloody, battered, but wearing a shit-eating grin crashes across several buildings. However, he recovered.
- Battra, who was flung as well, stopped his momentum with a wave of his arms. An incredulous look was etched on his previously calm face. 
- Breaking a singularity from the inside should have been imposible! The Nuclear Pulse seemingly destabilized it enough to shatter. In all of Battra's time as a sorceror, that has never occurred. His barriers were impenetrable! It's impossible that someone who is inherently capable of sorcery could break it. 
- Godzilla, his wounds now fully closed, returns again.
- But before his enemy could close in, Battra clasps again and another black sphere manifested.
- This dance would repeat again and again until Battra activates the singularity, turning it into a Black Hole.
- Monarch and the invaders were suddenly alarmed of a massive black hole in New York. But before either could pull drones and ships, it all got sucked in.
- 10 km afar, a massive transparent barrier was erected. It was constructed as soon as Battra entered New York. This was his countermeasure. Threatening Earth to be destroyed by a real black hole would trigger Mothra's full divine form, ending any of this conflict immediately. But if a barrier exists that minimizes the influence of the black hole, localizing the destruction, then nothing should happen. He had even made the barrier to be undetectable by Mothra's psychic probing.
- But approximately another 5 minutes after, the black hole is destroyed, massive blue energy erupts from its cosmic maw. 

## Phase 3

- Eventually, Battra turns to one of his trump cards: the Heart of the Protean. It possess the ability to adapt to any and all phenomena.
- With the HoP, he uses a shadowy mold of the King of the Monsters himself as the stone's host. 
- But that was not enough, from the shadows, a copy of the Queen of the Monsters came forth.
- Now it's a 3v1!
- Unfortunately, this is Battra's second greatest miscalculation in the fight: providing a blueprint for Godzilla's evolution.
- Godzilla who had his arm cut off by the clone of Mothra suddenly puts forth his stump of an arm and a sudden ray of concentrated atomic energy burst forth, aiming it at Battra. He muses that his enemy has been staggering lately. 
- The blasts finds its target and launches him off, crashing into several buildings. The energy engulfs him, severely limiting his control over his own sorcery.
- Battra, disposed, did not even see it; he did not even perceive it. He was suddenly jabbed, immense pain coursed through him within less than the span of a second. Every organ within his abdominal area was destroyed. And he was launched hundreds of feet away again, knocked out and seemingly dead.
- Now, Godzilla is free to play with these shadowy doppelgangers. But the punch he did had an invigorating effect on him. It has put him in the zone, his focus reaching new peaks.

## The Heart of Protean

### Physical Characteristics
- Plain gray stone that transforms as it adapts
- Multicolored streaks spread across surface like a canvas being painted
- Changes correspond to specific adaptations in progress

### Functional Mechanics
- Adapts to any phenomenon it experiences
- Adaptation occurs in stages - more exposure = stronger adaptation
- Must be actively used to continue adaptation
- If dormant, adaptations are paused rather than lost
- Extended dormancy leads to reset of adaptations
- Requires constant contact with phenomena it's adapting to

### Strategic Implementation
- Attached to shadow-Godzilla's crown during Phase 3
- Forces Battra to maintain the Umbra Simulacrum to preserve adaptations
- Creates strategic choice between maintaining adaptations and using other techniques
- Explains why the solar empire of sorcerers could still be defeated despite having this artifact

## Magic System Clarifications

### Time Manipulation
- Highly taboo, almost as forbidden as soul manipulation
- Requires separating a portion of reality from the universe
- Two methods of separation:
  - Creating pocket universes by stabilizing Primus
  - Creating "rooms" with perfect barrier seals
- Time manipulation within unsealed "rooms" risks affecting the entire universe
- Only perfectly sealed barriers allow safe time manipulation
- Maintaining such barriers is exhausting, making time manipulation impractical for most sorcerers
- Battra, as the greatest barrier architect, can create domains effortlessly

### Spell Paradigms (to be showcased in Phase 2)
- Procedural Magic: Sequential spell execution following defined steps
- Object-Oriented Magic: Techniques as encapsulated spell frameworks
- Declarative Magic: High-level spell design focusing on intent
- Event-Driven Magic: Triggered spells activating under specific conditions
- Reactive Magic: Self-adaptive spells adjusting to conditions
- Functional Magic: Spell composition and layering
- Parallel Magic: Multi-threaded spellcasting
- Concurrent Magic: Interdependent spellcasting

## Character Elements

### Battra's Emotional Connection
- Shadow clones represent Titan forms from before Battra's exile
- Memory perfectly preserved despite eons of separation
- Reveals Battra never forgot Godzilla and Mothra
- Demonstrates deep emotional connection beneath villainous exterior
- Creates psychological dimension to the physical battle

### Godzilla's Evolution
- Forces adaptation beyond mimicking Kong's techniques
- Pushes development of unique human-form fighting style
- Leads to achievement of "The Zone" state with perfect energy control
- Atomic Railgun represents first step in this evolution
- Clone of Titan-form self serves as literal mirror/blueprint for growth
