# Power Dynamics

### Battra's Leash

- Godzilla, Mothra, and Battra bound by formal Vow
- Establishes jurisdictional boundaries between their authorities
- Contains specific behavioral restrictions for Battra
- Includes non-disclosure provisions preventing discussion with others
- Creates enforcement mechanism not requiring direct Alpha intervention
- Unknown to Monarch but suspected by observant researchers

### The Godzilla-Mothra Vow

- Mirrors traditional Northern family structure (male external/female internal domains)
- Created coincidentally but functions as perfect expression of Northern tradition
- Godzilla handles Titan affairs, Mothra manages human concerns
- Explains Mothra's apparent disinterest in Titan politics
- Creates frustration among lower-ranked Titans who don't understand traditional structure

### Battra's Position

- Immune to Antitheriomorphosis through mastery of sorcery; uses a variety of shapeshifting techniques to maintain human form.
- Deliberately flaunts this ability to irritate other Titans
- Developing transformation orb technology to temporarily restore Titan forms
- Maintains complete control over orb production and distribution
- Next development target is Kong, progressing by complexity rather than hierarchy

### Kong's Challenges

- Rules Hollow Earth but facing increasing territorial disputes
- Younger Titans testing boundaries, forming new alliances
- Needed to suspend Castle Bravo visits to reestablish clear hierarchy
- Developing respect for Monarch's ESP and Sorcery students
- Represents potential future transformation orb recipient

### Castle Bravo Dynamics

- Mobile fortress maintained by Methuselah's abilities
- Requires constant management to prevent escalation
- Currently stabilized by balance between Battra's chaos and Anguirus's order
