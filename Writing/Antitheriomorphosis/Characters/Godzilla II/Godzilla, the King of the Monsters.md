# **Godzilla, The King of The Monsters**

> _“Onward, forevermore.”_

## Overview

Once feared as an unstoppable force of destruction, Godzilla has since become a figure of solemn authority. His rule is absolute, his presence inescapable—a relentless force of nature tempered by time and experience. Though his rage is legendary, it is not mindless fury but a deeply rooted instinct, now buried beneath the weight of responsibility. Those expecting a rampaging beast will instead find a sovereign burdened by the ages, his power restrained by sheer force of will.

A descendant of the [[Northerners]], one of the four great factions of _Titanus gojira_, Godzilla embodies their raw power and resilience. Unlike the [[Divine Moths]], whose immortality came at the cost of their magic, his kind has never possessed any affinity for such forces. Instead, they command energy itself, their bodies designed to absorb, manipulate, and weaponize it.
