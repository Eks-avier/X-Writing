## Background & History

### Early Promise

- Child prodigy in electronics and engineering
- Graduated top of his class from prestigious technical university at 22
- Recruited immediately by NeuroSync Technologies for specialized R&D
- Patented three significant innovations before age 24
- Married Sarah at 24, purchased Meadowvale home as “forever” residence

### The Fall

- Sarah's affair with yoga instructor and subsequent divorce (age 26) devastated him
- In-laws and parents sided with Sarah's narrative of Arthur's “emotional unavailability”
- Initial response: self-destructive behaviors (drinking, casual relationships, financial irresponsibility)
- Lost corporate position due to declining performance and erratic behavior
- Home (only asset kept in divorce) fell into disrepair during spiral

### The Turning Point: Xillien Invasion

- Witnessed a lower-tier Titan (Methuselah) unaffected by Antitheriomorphosis
- Was protected during attack, saw Titan's selfless sacrifice
- Began seeing parallels between himself and Titans: misunderstood, vilified, yet possessing potential
- Started researching Titan energy through available channels
- Acquired Ghidorah fragment through online auction of “experimental components”

### Current State

- Two years into tentative recovery when Nordsons arrive
- Working from home as freelance consultant while focusing on “breakthrough project”
- Still struggles with drinking but making efforts to moderate
- Finances stabilizing but precarious, adding urgency to project success
- Socially isolated but making small efforts to reconnect with community

## Relationships

### Family

- **Parents:** Initially supportive but believed Sarah's version of events; currently estranged
- **Ex-wife Sarah:** Left him for yoga instructor, now living in Sedona, Arizona
- **Former In-laws:** Actively antagonistic, spread negative narrative about him

### Community

- **Barbara Matthews:** Neighborhood gossip who maintains sympathetic but patronizing view
- **Dave Matthews:** Keeps professional distance but occasionally consults on home repair issues
- **Professional Colleagues:** Scattered contacts who recognize his talent but are wary of reliability

### Developing Relationships

- **Godric Nordson:** Potential mentor figure; Arthur senses something familiar yet different
- **Maria Nordson:** Represents the warmth and belonging Arthur craves
- **Meadowvale Community:** Beginning tentative reintegration through events like planning committee

## The Fragment Project

### Technical Aspects

- Experimental energy system integrating Ghidorah fragment as amplification component
- Goal: Create self-sustaining energy circuit with net positive output
- Current achievement: 150% energy return (theoretically impossible result)
- System housed in immaculate basement workshop
- Project documentation meticulous despite Arthur's otherwise chaotic life

### Psychological Significance

- **Professional Redemption:** Opportunity to prove his brilliance was real, not lost
- **Personal Validation:** Evidence his Titan fascination isn't delusion
- **Symbolic Rebirth:** Harnessing transformative energy as metaphor for personal change
- **Connection to Something Greater:** His way of touching the cosmic world of Titans
