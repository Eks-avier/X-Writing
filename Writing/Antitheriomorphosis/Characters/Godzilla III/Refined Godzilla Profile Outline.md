# Refined Godzilla Profile

# Physical Profile

## Physical Features

- **Human Name**: Godric Nordson
- **Titan Name**: Godzilla / Gojira
	- He answers to both equally
- **Height**: 6'5'' (196 cm)
- **Weight**: 265 lbs (120 kg)
- **Sex**: Male
- **Approximated Age**: 250 m.y. old
- **Documented Age**: 25
- **Birthday**: November 3
	- First resurgence in the modern era, as noted by Eiji Serizawa
	- Doubles as a meta-reference since the first Godzilla film was released in that date on 1954
- **Body Fat**: 10-12% (December-August); 15%-18% (September-November)
- **Eye Color**:
	- **Faux Eye Color**: Light blue (an effect of his atomic energy in use); default state
	- **True Eye Color**: Gold (maternal trait); rarely revealed, or at all
- **Others**:
	- Physical proportions are aesthetic
		- Nigh-perfect face harmony; all facial features are proportional to one another
		- Nigh-perfect anatomical symmetry and proportions
	- Originally right handed when first discovered by Monarch, is now fully ambidextrous
	- During the early days of his transformation, his body is cleanly shaved
		- He kept up the routine up until the following year
		- He doesn't bother now and has grown a modest amount of hair at places, particularly most noticeable around his arms, chest, legs and groin.
	- Random people in public who encounter him are surprised he's 25, often thinking he's older than that
		- A hint to his true age that people subconsciously pick up

### Facial Structure

Godric's face combines mathematical precision and balance with elemental weathering to create something simultaneously classical and primal.

- **Overall Shape**: Square with an angles and definition that is both pronounced yet not at all exaggerated
- **Jawline**: Sharply defined with perfect bilateral symmetry; creates a strong horizontal line
- **Cheekbones**: High and prominent without being too sharp nor dramatic, allowing for natural shadows to be produced beneath
- **Brow**: Strong, but neither overly heavy nor dramatic brow ridge that casts his eyes in a subtle shadow
- **Forehead**: Broad yet proportional and balanced; neither too high nor too low
- **Lips**: Full but definitively masculine, with a defined Cupid's bow
- **Chin**: Strong and slightly squared with a subtle cleft
- **Ears**: Close to the head with perfect symmetry and proportion
- **External Perception**: Often appears older than documented age due to stoic and regal bearing
- **Expression**: Predominantly stoic with subtle micro-expressions

His face maintains a perpetual stoic expression that occasionally produces micro-expressions only those who are closest to him can detect and parse.

The classical balance creates an almost sculptural quality while the subtle weathering all through out expresses motion and experience that no mere sculpture could achieve.

## Uncanny Symmetry

Godric's near-perfect 98.7% bilateral symmetry creates an unconscious, instinctual discomfort in observers, leading their brains to register something fundamentally inhuman without the capacity to articulate why.

- Perfectly aligned features on both sides of his face
- Identical musculature development on both sides of the body
- Fingerprints that almost look too identical
- A near-perfect distribution of modest body hair
- Perfect alignment of teeth

## Balanced Blend of European Ethnicities

In an effort to properly translate his Northern *Titanus gojira* heritage, the mysterious Antitheriomorphosis has drawn from subtle yet unmistakable Northern European aesthetics, that is then blended with primarily with Mediterranean ideals and subtly with Slavic ones.

| **Heritage Influence** | **Percentage** | **Primary Features**                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nordic & Germanic**  | 30%            | Strong jawline, brow structure, height proportions          |
| **Greco-Roman**        | 25%            | Nose structure, facial symmetry, golden-ratio adherence     |
| **Celtic**             | 25%            | Skin texture, muscular density, slight weathering quality   |
| **Slavic**             | 20%            | Subtle cheekbone structure, eye placement, neck musculature |

This blend produces a face that seems broadly recognizable to Northern Europeans, until he moves his face. Such an effect makes him familiar yet unplaceable. Sometimes he'll appear a marvel of antiquity, and sometimes he'll seem like a master of the wilderness.

### Refined Ruggedness

> [!important] Rugged Regality
> Godric embodies a peculiar contradiction: mathematical perfection merged cleanly with primordial wilderness, a man of order and an untamed beast

#### The Aesthetics of Antiquity

When Godric grooms himself, his features allow him to effortlessly appear as the perfect classical specimen ready for display in a museum. He leaves an impossible impression on people: a Renaissance painting made real. When people look at him, they see an air nobility and natural authority - a CEO of a high-end lucrative company or a rightful king of a nation. Though Monarch makes an earnest effort to include the Antitheriomorphosized Titans into prestigious events - and are able to find some measure of success in doing so - they seem to be unable to hide one inconspicuous Mr. Nordson from grabbing people's attention with his Adonic aesthetics, despite completely misinterpreting people's reactions to him.

#### The Virility of Ruggedness

When Godric allows his shaving routine to lapse - or during his dormant period - he shifts from an Adonic figure to something Heraclean - wilder, more primal. He calls to mind the image of a man steadfastly tending his ranch, a seasoned hunter tracking his next quarry with unwavering precision. When he people see him in this state, he appears not merely as one who survives the wilderness through skill, but as one who has mastered it - and stands ready to shield others against its brutal forces. This ruggedness reflect his unbroken reality as *the* apex predator of Earth, one who has to weather the constant challenges of life and distinguished by his unerring triumph over them.

### Hair

It seems that the coloration of his hair correlates to the coloration of his dorsal fins, which is interesting as his scale color, dorsal fin color and true eye color were inherited from his mother. Such traits within *Titanus gojira* are rare, often likened to a human redhead. Each major faction of *T. gojira* has different colorations. For a typical Northerner like Godzilla's father Dagon, he has charcoal gray scale coloration, dorsal fins as white as snow, and eyes blue as ice. Godric, and his mother in this case, have scales and dorsal fins the color of night with golden eyes.

- **Color**: Pure black
- **Texture**: Appears soft and is soft to the touch yet resists cutting by conventional tools
- **Previous Experiments**: He has attempted to fix his hair in various styles:
	- His prior shoulder length look, which he tied back
	- His buzz cut
- **Future Experiments**: He seeks to cut his hair by a few centimeters longer than a buzz cut
- **Notes**: Determines how long his hair is by the length of the strands falling on his forehead. If a single strand reaches his eyes, he may begin considering a cut.

#### Facial Hair

Godric's facial hair seems to be capable of transforming him from ranger to regent in a span of a day.

- **Clean-Shaven**: During mornings, his shaving routine reveals the classical museum specimen - marked by a perfect jawline, defined features
- **12-Hour Stubble**: When evening comes, a faint shadow appears, hinting at his rugged and immediate nature
- **24-Hour Growth**: A protector against the wilderness emerges from classical aesthetics
- **48-Hour Growth**: Complete character shift - a primal protector with perfect underlying structure
- **3-5 Day Growth**: Peak rugged allure - a virile man with regal bearing.

This accelerated growth pattern plateaus at approximately 5mm length, creating a perfect stubble perpetually - unless maintained into a short beard, though it usually never gets to this point.

### Eyes

- **Faux Eye Color**: Light blue (default state)
- **True Eye Color**: Gold

To most people, and even to Monarch, Godric's eyes is a striking light blue. This is accurately represented in all his documentations prepared by Monarch.

However, to those who know him intimately, his true eye color is gold, which he inherited from his mother instead of the standard shades of blue of the Northern Race of *Titanus gojira* like his father. Though, as a result of atomic energy coursing through him, his eyes are often obscured by its bluish hue.

A *Titanus gojira* constantly has atomic energy coursing through its veins, though it is typically not enough to conceal their natural eye colors. This suggests that Godric is constantly on guard for literal millions of years. Hence, even when in moments where he seems to be immobile and resting, his eyes remain blue. Seldom does the gold ever reveal itself, a symbol of his perpetual vigilance.

His gold eyes only reveal themselves when his guard is down, causing his energy to course regularly, or when he is emotionally authentic with people. Both scenarios happen so rarely that despite existing for a quarter of a billion years, his true eye color has only been seen by a handful of beings.

### Skin

From afar, his skin appears relatively normal: a young man's weathered skin brought about by constant outdoor work. From up close, an interesting phenomenon can be observed: his skin is paradoxically both perfect *and* weathered - neither damaged nor scarred, but textured by his perpetual exposure to the elements.

- **Color**: Caucasian with slight tan
	- The tan is caused by his constant exposure in the sun
	- It fades when winter comes
- **Base Texture**: Slightly rougher than expected, like weathered leather that endured the years.
- **Appearance**: Neither damaged nor scarred, but textured by constant exposure to the outdoors.
- **Touch Sensation**: Warm and firm, in striking contrast to common expectation, with microscopic variations that lend a subtle yet captivating tactile richness.
- **Response**: Slightly resistant to pressure, like a surface that has adapted to withstand incredible forces.
- **Overall Effect**: It beckons someone to a person who has lived outdoors for decades, despite his actual exposure spanning eons.
- **Distinctive Features**:
	- A complete absence of blemishes
	- No scars despite millions of years of combat
	- No birthmarks or identifying marks of any kind
	- Refuses any tattoos
		- They fade almost immediately

Among *Titanus gojira*, markings of any kind are typically a result of an ineffective regenerative system, hence his avoidance of any kind of markings even in human form. Both his mind and his body reject such notions.

- **Radiation Properties**: Passively emits low levels of radiation that sterilize the immediate area around him

### Hands

His hands possess perfect proportions, following golden ringer ration lengths. They are subtly calloused and textured despite possessing perfect regeneration, making him seem to have known manual labor - which they indubitably do - despite healing any damage. One popular theory from Monarch attempts to explain this phenomenon through the constant radiation he is emitting actively remodelling his tissues to maintain optimal function.

### Dental Features

His teeth appear entirely human at a glance.

- **Appearance**: Perfectly aligned with conventional human dimensions
- **Capabilities**:
	- Regenerate if damaged
	- Record-setting bite force beyond any documented species
		- He was once instructed to bite through reinforced steel.
			- He succeeded with minimal effort
- **Maintenance**: Self-sterilizing due to his passive radiation

### Anatomical Proportions

Godric's anatomy is one of the closest things to perfection most humans would ever see, demonstrating the undeniable peak of the human male physique.

#### Key Measurements

#### Golden Ratio Architecture

Godric's physique demonstrates the golden ration across many anatomical relationships:

| Relationship               | Measurement [cm] | Ratio | Notes                         |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| **Height to Navel**        | 196 to 121       | 1.619 | Perfect golden ratio division |
| **Shoulder to Waist**      | 54.6 to 33.7     | 1.620 | Classic V-taper proportion    |
| **Upper to Lower Leg**     | 59.3 to 36.7     | 1.616 | Ideal leg segmentation        |
| **Forearm to Hand**        | 35.6 to 22.1     | 1.611 | Harmonious arm extension      |
| **Arm Length to Torso**    | 89.1 to 55.0     | 1.620 | Perfect extension proportion  |
| **Hand Length to Palm**    | 22.1 to 13.6     | 1.623 | Classical proportioning       |
| **Neck to Head Height**    | 16.2 to 26.3     | 1.623 | Regal bearing proportion      |

| **Facial Width to Height** | 16.2 to 26.3     | 1.623 | Balanced facial structure     |

## Physical Characteristics

Godric's movement patterns reflect his stoic and regal nature.

- **Gait**: Economic and tactical, utilizing minimal energy for maximum effort
- **Grace**: Surprisingly graceful despite his imposing frame
- **Balance**: Perfect equilibrium in all positions or terrain
	- When he kept tripping over himself during his first moments as a human, it's because he still moved as if he had a tail.
- **Posture**: Effortless military bearing, with a spine perfectly aligned
- **Quirks**:
	- Never bows, even when it is required
	- Never looks down to those smaller than him
	- Never looks up to those taller than him
	- These are all subconscious, people are forced to adjust to him

His mere presence creates certain physiological effects on others, whether Titan, human, or animal.

- Animals either cower or become submissive
- The fight-or-flight response is passively triggered for most humans
	- People often find reason to leave him or defer to him
- Some people do get used to the sensation or are curiously not affected, though this phenomena is incredibly rare.
	- As far as people are concerned only Madison Russell is unaffected, allowing her to act in light-hearted ways with him
		- Godric very much appreciates this
- **Sunbathing**: A habit he likes to do recreationally; it also allows him to absorb solar energy at the same time
- **Voice**:
	- Deep, resonant baritone
	- Naturally rich and clear
	- Velvety smooth, with natural gravitas that can easily command attention
		- Can definitely be mistaken as seductive, though that's just delusion most of the time
	- Can fill a room without even trying
	- Doesn't have any particular side effects besides being attractive to people
	- **Speech**:
		- Measured and deliberately paced; rarely rushes words
		- Naturally emphasizes important points
		- Economical with word choice
			- Naturally selects the most concise way to speak

### Heavier Than He Looks

The most significant disconnect between Godric's appearance and reality is his extraordinary density:
- **Appears to have proportions of someone weighing**: 85-90 kg (187-198 lbs)
- **Actual weight**: 120 kg (265 lbs)
- **Effective density**: Approximately 1.35× greater than his appearance suggests

This density is distributed throughout his entire structure:
- Bone density 2.6 g/cm³ (human average: 1.5-1.8 g/cm³)
- Muscle tissue density 1.9 g/cm³ (human average: 1.06 g/cm³)
- Organ tissue density approximately 1.3× human average

### Proximity Effects

Humans tend to experience a predictable pattern of responses based on their distance from Godric. From afar, they see a conventionally handsome young man, but the closer they get to him, the more they *feel* his inherent predatory presence.

| **Distance**    | **Conscious Response**            | **Subconscious Response**                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **>15 meters**  | Conventional attraction           | Normal social interest                   |
| **5-15 meters** | Recognition of unusual perfection | Growing unease with continued attraction |
| **<5 meters**   | Awareness of commanding presence  | Fight-or-flight activation               |

This layered perception allows Godric to move through human society with minimal - relative to his previous form as a Titan - disruption. Most people would never get close enough to experience his true predatory presence.

Humans possess evolutionary memory of predator encounters in their limbic system. What they experience near Godric is the activation of ancient survival circuits:

- Recognition patterns for apex predator presence
- Instinctive submission behaviors preserved from evolutionary history
- Territorial deference mechanisms embedded in primate psychology

### Biological Advantages

- **Thermal Regulation**: His elevated temperature allows him to be unaffected by the cold
	- Hence why he requires little to no clothing in winter
		- Though of course he attempts to cover this up to avoid suspicion
- **Passive Sterilization**: Passive radiation emission naturally eliminates all bacteria and pathogens
	- Renders traditional hygiene products unnecessary
	- Maintains effortless pristine cleanliness
- **Bathing Preferences**: Rarely requires bathes for hygienic purposes
	- Prefers complete submersion when bathing for pleasure and recreation
		- The only moment he will ever be unclothed
			- Mark, anticipating this preference, initiated that he have a personal pool in Castle Bravo that only Godric himself can access.
				- *Dad, this isn't necessary--*
				- *You haven't heard what they whisper; it's for their own safety, not his.*
		- In the dark of night, he will drop into the waters surrounding Castle Bravo to swim leisurely.
			- *The Bermuda should be honored the King of the Monsters finds its waters pleasing.* - Madison Russell
			- *That's a bit too dramatic, don't you think?* - Dr. Rick Stanton
		- Stays submerged underwater for extended periods, alarming people who don't know who he is
			- He can hold his breath for an extended amount of time
				- Learning of ways to indefinitely remain submerged again.
			- Waters he submerges in are treated as hazards, hence the secondary excuse of his private pool
				- *What's the primary excuse then?*
				- *Avoiding sexual harassment.*
- **Product Usage**: Requires minimal toiletry
	- Still uses basic products suggested by Madison, particularly when it concerns his hair
	- Scents don't adhere to his skin
	- Possesses a unique scent
- **Radiation Cleansing**: When finding himself absolutely filthy, employs an elevated energy output
	- Heats everything to the point of boiling in a short radius around him
	- Lethal to non-Titans

### Biohazard Considerations

- **Bodily Fluids**: All of them are potentially harmful to humans
	- Elevated temperature during his power use alone can cause damage!
	- His radioactive emissions can vary with emotional and physical state
	- Direct contact protocols were implemented
- **Adaptation Phenomenon**: Certain humans can stand to be in his vicinity, though how this is possible eludes scientists.
	- Monarch upper management shows reduced sensitivity to radioactive effects
	- Long-term exposure seems to play a part in creating limited adaptation
	- People are unsure whether this is Godzilla's improvements in modulation or an adaptive response in the humans he's commonly found with.
		- Fuels people's delusional desires to be near him even more
			- *You didn't have to mention that little factoid; now everyone's gonna try clamoring over him more!*
		- Both theories are considered, though most lean heavily into Godric's improving control

> “That is *so* cool!”
> “Madison, it's not cool to be tagged for potential radioactive contaminat-”
> “Am I gonna breathe atomic energy too?!”
> “God help us all if that ever happened.”

## Seasonal Physique Variation

> [!important] Voluntary Cycle
> Unlike other organisms whose seasonal changes are driven by biological imperatives, Godric's seasonal cycle represents a purely voluntary adaptation following the Antitheriomorphosis.

- **Active Season**:
	- 10% to 12% body fat
	- Spans from December to August
	- Defined musculature
	- Angular facial features
	- Higher body temperature
- **Dormant Period**:
	- 15% to 18% body fat
	- Spans September to November
	- Softer musculature
	- Softened facial features
	- Lower body temperature
- **Notes**:
	- Established post-Antitheriomorphosis
	- Began in 2021

To achieve this bulk, **he has to eat more**.

> [!note] Energy Source Transition
> During dormant periods, Godric's metabolism shifts from radiation-based to conventional nutrition—a state that more closely resembles human metabolic processes. This represents the only time he genuinely requires food rather than consuming it for pleasure or social integration.

> [!note] The Winter Awakening
The winter of 2020 marked a pivotal moment when Maria's attraction to Godric first awakened. His dormant appearance—larger frame, softer features, stubbled face, and clothes seemingly straining against his increased bulk despite their flexible material—presented a more rugged, masculine presence that contrasted with his typically precise, angular form.

## Attire

### Daily

- **Color Palette**: The following colors are ordered according to preference
	1. Black
	2. White
	3. Charcoal gray
	4. Navy blues
	5. Forest greens
- **Clothing Material**: *All* clothing used to be breathable, flexible, durable, and comfortable materials but upon Mothra getting into the hobby of garment making, she personally replaced each of his clothes' material with her own silk.
	- Any other new clothes he would have are made with her silk, which is:
		- Supremely durable
			- Bulletproof and also proofed against other high-speed projectiles
			- Fireproof
			- Waterproof
			- Highly blast resistant
		- Highly flexible
			- He can comfortably fight in them
			- Returns to its original form if stretched
		- Easily maintainable
			- Mothra can simply repair it herself, and she produces unlimited silk
			- Cleaning it is just as effortless as typical dirt and stains do not cling to them
		- Can channel his atomic energy albeit limitedly
			- High energy output can compromise the integrity of the clothes
- **Clothing Style**: Simple, functional, form-fitting, and unembellished clothing that allows for mobility and agility
- **Shirts**: Nearly all of his shirts are long-sleeved button-downs
	- **Colors**: 40% white, 40% black, 10% grays, 9% navy blues, 1% forest greens
		- He only has **one** green shirt.
			- It came from a set of three, along with a blue and black shirt that was given to him
	- **Alternatives**: Possesses 10 plain form-fitting t-shirts and 3 henleys, one white and two black
		- Though they have been remade with Mothra's silk, he has never found use for them
			- *Can I throw these out?*
			- *Absolutely not, big guy—you have zero variety as it is!*
	- **Undershirts**: Plain black or white variants
		- Uses them from time to time as Mothra finds his chest hair distracting
			- Apparently, she is also distracted when she sees his undershirt peeking
				- *What does she even want at this point?!*
		- Now wears them whenever he feels like it, typically in winter so he has an excuse to look cold even though he really isn't
- **Underpants**: Owns a variety of the following and *all* are black:
	- 70% boxer briefs, 15% midway briefs, 10% boxer shorts, 5% briefs
		- He only uses boxer shorts and briefs in his private quarters and when he is lounging
			- Of course no one but him knows this, but Mothra has observed such pattern
				- Funnily enough, it's the half-blind Baragon that was urged by Madison to detect, through his earth-sense, what each Titan's preferred underpants is.
					- She then wrote a paper that documented her findings with Baragon as her accomplice.
- **Trousers**: Nearly every single pair of trousers he possesses are tactical pants but with vastly reduced amount of pockets
	- They appear nearly like formal trousers
		- He hates having too many pockets as they are too bulky and unnecessary
			- Anguirus/Alexios on the contrary likes pockets and makes up for both of them
				- Godzilla/Godric never asked for that but he appreciates the gesture
- **Shorts**: Predominantly swimming trunks and are all black in color
	- He rarely uses them, even for their intended purpose, as his trousers are typically do the job
		- *Drag? I care not.*

> [!quote]
> *She's looking again; is it really so distracting?*
> *There's a lot of distracting things about you and your physique, big guy.*
> *I stopped shaving… should I resume doing so?*
> *Do you want to?*
> *I suppose I can afford to put an undershirt on.*
> *You can't be this dense.*
> *I am more than a hundred kilograms., after all.*

### Formal Attire

Godric has a modest collection of formal attire that he typically uses when he attends formal events involving Monarch.

Because the Titans-turned-humans aren't revealed to the world, he doesn't appear as a distinguished guest but just a background presence. He is sometimes accompanied by either Maria or Alexios, who do have some measure of appreciation for the formal atmosphere. The rest find no reason to participate. However, try as he might, Nordson still manages to find himself attracting or intimidating heads, often slowly finding himself at the center without his knowing.

#### Suits

- **Collection**: He possesses a modest number of 7 suits. Some were gifted to him and some were made by Mothra herself. All of them however, were modified by Mothra to integrate her silk.
	- 4 single-breasted suits
		- 2 black
		- 1 navy blue
		- 1 charcoal gray
	- 3 double-breasted suits
		- 1 black
		- 1 navy blue
		- 1 forest green
			- Gifted to him by Mark in the Christmas of 2020
				- Godric greatly appreciates the gesture, but has not find a use for it
					- Mark doesn't mind, he's just secretly happy Godric didn't reject it

### Accessories

- **Ties**: He *hates* wearing them, Maria and Madison have to painfully negotiate with him to wear them in required events, often having to strike unfair deals in the process.
	- However, he does possess some and they are all solid-colored:
		- 3 black
		- 1 charcoal gray
		- 1 navy blue
		- 1 gold
			- Made for him by Maria because she's one of the very few beings who has seen his true eye color, and she thought a gold tie would complement his eyes so well.
			- He has not even removed it from its specially made case that Maria stores every garment she wears.
	- His ties are reinforced with his shed scales despite infrequent use
	-  They are never patterned or decorative
- **Cufflinks**: Single pair of matte obsidian black cufflinks
	- Contains microscopic fragments of his shed dorsal fins
	- Glows subtly when he's using his power
- **Pocket Squares**: Two plain white square, often folded identically every time.
	- He seldom uses them

On a slightly unrelated tangent, the combination of Godzilla scales and hide and Mothra's silk provides a material that is nigh-indestructible while maintaining an almost comical lightness.

Monarch has attempted to synthesize it repeatedly to no avail; they got the durability down, but not the regenerative capability or the energy compatibility. They won't even bother with Mothra's silk, it's utterly impossible. Besides, she's rather generous with it anyway.

### Personal Artifacts

As for some of his personal artifacts:
- A pocket watch from Ishiro's father Eiji Serizawa; nonfunctional, its hands are stuck due to the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima
	- It was entrusted in Mark's care before he delivered the nuclear warhead, in what would now be confirmed as Atlantis, to a Godzilla injured by the Oxygen Destroyer.
	- Godric is debating on making it work again.
- Several leather-bound notebooks that contained the personal thoughts, theories, and analyses of Ishiro and his father on Godzilla through the years.
	- Eiji's notebooks were originally entrusted to Vivienne Graham, who then was passed down to Mark when she died.
		- Ishiro gave his own notebooks to Mark just before he sacrificed himself.
	- Godric sometimes reads them, musing on their thoughts on him. It's fun to read what the men who chased him for decades thought, sometimes wishing Ishiro was still alive for conversation.
		- He found it funny; no one would have been more delighted to see him as a human.
- Dagon's dorsal fin that Godzilla took from his skeletal remains when he finally saw it in late-2020. It remains in a special pendant that he wears. This fin would be the one he uses to represent the Northern faction of their species in the forging of his crown.
- A state-of-the-art and latest model smartphone. Bought with Monarch's funds by Madison, it *should* have served as a way to contact Godric. But, he doesn't use it. In fact, most people don't even see him carry it. Whether or not it's because he doesn't know how to use it or he can't be bothered is a mystery. It's often in Madison's hands along with her personal phone.
	- Dr. Stanton offered to have it sent to their science division to run on his atomic energy.
         - Godric did not respond, but the offer remains open.
	- When asked why she has it all the time, her excuse is that she's just setting up his apps and accounts despite the fact she can be seen gaming or taking photos of herself (*The cameras are amazing!*).
- A state-of-the-art and latest in model tablet. At least this one people had seen him use. It's where people typically voice call with him. Though beyond that purpose, he doesn't use it. Once again, Madison is seen gaming on them or using it for her own musings.
- A leather wallet. Plain, black, and empty. Monarch usually handles their finances.
- Specialized IDs that are typically used to access facilities in Monarch. Every Titan has one that also documents what they are and what their status is. Godric doesn't need it though, who's gonna stop him? It's more of a pretense and formality.
- Other governmental IDs. He has a collection of every essential in most countries. These usually populate his wallet if he sought to bring them, though Monarch just usually handles it for him as precaution to avoid being revealed. Mark surprisingly takes it seriously and Godric approves.
- Socks made with Mothra's silk. Plain, black, and in various lengths. He doesn't care which pair and what length they are when he wears them, though Madison seems to be under the impression there's rhyme or reason in his selection. Takes care of them very well, often seen supplying it with extra radiation to speed up repair.
- Belts that are made with conventional materials with some subtle presences of Mothra's silk. This is a target for integration with future shed material.
	- Their designs are plain, modest, with no embellishments
	- They come in different types that Godric takes into account when choosing his attires for the week. The buckles, too, also have varying designs.
	- Maria has her favorites, though she never says which. She just stares.

### Titan Regalia

This uniform is modeled after a typical three-piece suit, though modified to greatly enable combat.

For the jacket:
- **Type**: Frock coat
- **Length**: Knee-length
- **Texture**: Rougher than his typical attire, an indication of greater scale count but not completely as it is still smoothened by Mothra's silk
- **Fit**:
	- Highly flattering on his physique
	- Tapered at his torso
	- Enables high mobility in combat, not the opposite
- **Design**:
	- Single-breasted
	- Vents that enable seamless leg movement
- **Utility**: Contains a modest amount of pockets to put stuff in though Godric carries little or at all
- **Preferences**:
	- Typically keeps it unbuttoned, though it's theorized by most that he either forgets or doesn't care about it
	- Keeps it on at all times, even in a fight, but removes it when entering closed off areas where no combat is expected.

For the waistcoat:
- **Type**: Double-breasted, buttoned
- **Texture**: Smoother than his coat, but the same scale-like feel remains present
- **Fit**:
	- Hugs his physique excellently
	- Does not impede combat mobility
- **Design**:
	- Complements his jacket
	- Features interconnected shapes, which from afar seemed random, but are actually just his dorsal fins.
		- These aren't featured prominently; from afar, they seem plain
- **Preferences**:
	- On occasion, perhaps twice in a week, he will be seen using it with his daily attire
		- Seems to be his favorite due to this versatility
	- He doesn't seem warm when wearing it

For the shirt:
- He just uses his daily ones
	- **Colors**: White or black
- **Preference**:
	- It's guaranteed he will wear white if his waistcoat is used with his daily.
	- Will typically be seen wearing a black shirt when in a formal occasions, but isn't opposed to using whites either.
	- Sometimes wears an undershirt, the color of which matches his shirt
		- White for white shirts
		- Black for all the other colors

> [!quote] Layered Deception
> “Perhaps with these four layers, people will cease questioning me if I'm cold for winter.”
> “Big guy, you're still underdressed. Do you know how many layers people wear in winter?”

For the trousers:
-  Perfectly identical to his typical ones had they not feature the same patterns and material as his vest and jacket.
	- Most are surprised he wouldn't use his daily pants here (*Please don't tempt him to do so.* )
- **Fit**: Enables, rather than impedes, his combat.
	- Somehow more flattering on his lower region that his usual trousers.

> [!quote]
> “I will fire anyone who says and answers the question “How big is he?”. For the love of God, people, have some shame, that's not just a Titan, but the King of the Monsters himself.”
> “Dad, you do realize that's not gonna stop them, right?”
> “As long as I don't hear it, I don't care; but *please* Madison… please encourage people to have a little bit of shame and dignity”

## Clothing Philosophy and Presentation

> [!important] Territory Management Through Appearance
> “Proper clothing is a signal of proper territory management, which signals his status.”

Godric's approach to clothing evolved from initial confusion to understanding it as status projection:

### The Evolution of Understanding

- **Initial Disconnect**: Struggled to comprehend purpose of clothing given his invulnerability
- **Madison's Insight**: Reframed clothing as visual representation of hierarchical position
- **Current Philosophy**: Views clothing as extension of personal territory and status marker

### Armor Symbolism

Despite requiring no physical protection, his clothing has evolved into genuine armor:

- **Maria's Silk Integration**: All garments remade with divine moth silk
- **Scale Reinforcement**: Key items infused with shed scales
- **Durability Enhancement**: Combined materials create genuinely protective layer
- **Regenerative Properties**: Silk-scale blend maintains integrity through self-repair
- **Energy Compatibility**: Limited ability to channel atomic energy

### Material Preferences

- **Pre-Silk Phase**: Struggled with conventional fabrics that deteriorated too quickly
- **Denim Aversion**: Particularly dislikes this material
- **Flexibility Requirement**: Prioritizes materials allowing combat mobility
- **Current Preference**: Exclusively wears Maria's silk-based garments

### Modesty Standard

- **Coverage Prioritization**: Maintains full coverage in all public settings
- **Species Values**: For *Titanus gojira*, maximum coverage signals superiority
- **Practical Approach**: Long sleeves and full pants in all settings regardless of temperature
- **Formal Preference**: Button-downs, tactical pants, proper shoes

## Personal Territories

> [!info] Territorial Management
In response to growing restlessness among humanized Titans in early 2021, Mark Russell initiated the creation of three dedicated facilities for Godric to provide necessary territorial stability.

### Private Pool

A large swimming facility that is exclusively meant for his use. It features an underwater hatch that provides an exit or entry way into open ocean. It serves Godric's multiple needs, mainly a need for recreational activity via swimming, an exit point for nighttime ocean excursions, and a connection to global patrol routes. Only Godric himself is allowed unrestricted access; the rest require his explicit permission. It's monitoring protocols only exist at entry points, allowing him to truly be in his natural element.

### Private Training Facility

Connected to the pool, it serves as a space for calibrating his strength and practicing control with the human body. Prior to this facility, he used to train how to control his titanic strength at laboratories within Castle Bravo, now he has his own private gym.

It features specialized reinforced materials intended to withstand his strength, but it remains insufficient to truly test his capabilities. Thus, he uses it as a way to understand strength modulation through conventional human exercise forms, often weightlifting. It's access is limited to Maria, Alexios, Roman, Mark, and Madison by invitation.

### Private Quarters

It is a slightly enlarged standard quarters with ocean-facing windows. As with most of his arrangements, it's minimal - spartan - and filled only with his essentials, limited only to his wardrobe and a few significant artifacts with historical meaning. It sole purpose is to give him a space for solitude, contemplation, and during dormant periods: rest.

### Command Center Territory

Despite not having full ownership of this space, Godric has established subtle territorial claims with within shared space. He has specific stations that others instinctively avoid, the ability to stand whenever he wants at the observation windows overlooking the sea, and some subtle environment markers recognizable only to his fellow Titans.

## Personal Organization

It's not just for his footwear! His meticulousness for his property is universal! They expected his quarters at the underwater base Castle Bravo to look like a cavern with stuff tossed around.

“You expected the quarters of the Titan who brought all the rest to heel for millions of years to look like a frat boy's dorm room?”

Instead they found his clothes and accessories lined up in his wardrobe. He seemed to have planned his attire for the entire week. His bed is neatly made, though it's as plain as they expected.

“It looks like one of those memes where they show a man's room and it's just a blanket on the floor with nothing else.”

He does his own laundry, his own room cleaning, even the door of his room is spotless. He does the maintenance for all of them too. Madison once spotted him with several books in hand, all neatly piled up, with the one he's reading bookmarked.

“A king is a king, apparently.”

When asked, Godric simply said that he doesn't like his territory to look ugly.

## Pickup Truck

Alright, now let's go to one of his more unexpected possessions: his pickup truck.

Born from an unexpected prompt, Godric's pickup was not in his list of possessions, yet it eventually evolved to be a part of his person.

When Rodan was still learning to fly, not with his wings but with aerokinesis, he demanded that he have a custom-made motorcycle after watching too many moto vlogs in YouTube. He reasoned that it fulfilled his desire to go fast, his independence from being stuck in an underwater base without either crashing on the ocean surface after a failed flight or through helicopters and planes, and his curiosity about human technology, particularly transportation methods.

A lightbulb in her head, Madison thought it would do all the currently gathered Titans on Castle Bravo to also receive vehicles of their own. For once, her father agreed with one of her outlandish ideas as carrying Titans by helicopter or plane was getting increasingly expensive especially when they wanted to explore human civilization. They cut their expenses while the Titans learn how to navigate on their own, as well as learning to be responsible of human technology. Besides, it also helped with the hiding the Titans protocol, who expects a giant monster to drive?

Once Rodan was sufficiently satisfied, they moved to Godzilla out of respect. Madison thought she'd deal with him personally to avoid any friction. Out of all the various options they viewed, from sports cars to motorcycles, Godric settled on a pickup truck.

Madison was wise not to question.

His truck is black, completely without embellishment, and powerful. Once again, he was offered to have it run on atomic energy. Monarch seems to be so eager to do that. But, he declined as he wanted to fully experience owning a vehicle. He only wanted some subtle shielding from his radiation, though he had gotten better at controlling its emission.

Of all the parts of his truck, his favorite is the pickup bed. He had deliberately left some pillows, a comforter, and even a portable hammock in his truck that he can put on the bed anytime so he can consistently stargaze.

For that alone, he preferred rural locations far away from cities. With his vision, who knows what he can see?

Driving, as people found, was approached with the same meticulousness as his personal organization. It seems that Monarch really has to stop assuming he'd be primal in his habits.

Though he finds traffic customs questionable, he still follows them with mechanical perfection. After all, the Alpha Paramount should claim victory in whatever he does, even in the mundane. It's less of him submitting to rules and more so a declaration of victory in a competition no one was in.

When it comes to maintenance, he approaches it with the same fastidiousness as he does with any of his possessions. Madison saw him one day with his owner's manual, two or three books on vehicle maintenance, and a curious video on the same topic in his YouTube history (because she has his devices), and the next he was on his vehicle working. It's his territory and it demands he take good care of it.

He had sought to first explore the USA before moving on to Europe and Asia. He'd pay for the journeys himself.

### Road Presence

His commanding presence extends beyond formal settings to everyday situations:

- **Traffic Interactions**: Nearly zero incidents despite extensive travel
  - Other drivers instinctively maintain distance from his vehicle
  - A single glare sufficient to deter even the most aggressive motorists
  - No recorded instances of road rage directed toward him
- **Public Recognition**: Despite covert status, creates unmistakable impression
  - Gas station attendants remember him but cannot explain why
  - Service professionals demonstrate unusual deference without understanding reason
  - Local law enforcement unconsciously avoid pulling over his vehicle

> [!quote] Instinctual Response
> “I was about to honk at the black pickup that was driving exactly the speed limit, but when I got alongside and saw the driver… I suddenly remembered I needed to take the next exit.”
> —Motorist account from Monarch surveillance transcript

## Financial Independence & Historical Witness

While Godric's meticulous nature extends to most aspects of his existence, even his patience has boundaries. Financial administration represents one domain he willingly delegates to Monarch, focusing his attention on matters more befitting the Alpha Paramount.

### Atlantean Revenue Stream

Godric maintains complete financial independence through a uniquely historical method:

- **Artifact Recovery**: Personal retrieval of Atlantean treasures
  - Locations precisely remembered from time as the region's “ward”
  - Items dated between 12,000-14,000 years old
  - Recovery operations conducted independently without assistance
  - Artifacts partially preserved despite Serizawa's nuclear detonation
- **Historical Significance**: Items verify existence of mythological civilization
  - Archaeological community initially skeptical until authentication
  - Multiple scholarly paradigms shattered by confirmation
  - Represents direct physical evidence of pre-historical advanced civilization
- **Distribution System**: Transfers artifacts to Monarch for museum placement
  - Items loaned rather than sold to maintain ownership
  - Generous compensation negotiated by Monarch on his behalf
  - Funds directed to personal accounts for discretionary use
- **Financial Scale**: Revenue sufficient to fund “several generations”
  - Maintains complete independence from Monarch financial support
  - Covers all personal expenses including vehicle maintenance and travel
  - Accumulates substantial reserves for future contingencies

> [!quote] Historical Irony
> “They would wave treasures in front of my snout thinking I wouldn't see or remember them. How odd that now they are the ones forgotten.”
> —Godric, regarding Atlantean artifacts

### Living Witness to Myth

Godric's connection to Atlantis represents a profound historical significance:

- **Historical Confirmation**: His first-hand knowledge verified what was considered mythical
  - Identified architectural details impossible to fabricate
  - Provided locations unknown to modern archaeology
  - Described cultural practices since confirmed by recovered artifacts
- **Timeline Verification**: Direct observation places Atlantis approximately 12,000 years ago
  - Predates conventional understanding of complex civilization
  - Corresponds with geological evidence of significant sea level changes
  - Aligns with scattered mythological references across cultures
- **Public Impact**: Revelation comparable to confirmation of Titans themselves
  - Scientific community forced to reconsider historical paradigms
  - Public fascination with both Titans and ancient civilizations intensified
  - Conspiracy theorists simultaneously validated and confused

> [!quote] Paradigm Shift
> “How would a person react when not only are Titans real but, apparently, the ancient and legendary city of Atlantis exists?”
> —Dr. Chen's preliminary report on public response to Atlantean discoveries

### Financial Management Approach

Despite delegating administration, Godric maintains characteristic oversight:

- **Delegation Parameters**: Clear boundaries for Monarch financial management
  - Handles fundamental paperwork and regulatory compliance
  - Manages investment portfolio according to specific guidelines
  - Provides regular detailed accounting for his review
- **Personal Involvement**: Maintains ultimate decision authority
  - Reviews financial status with same precision as territory assessments
  - Authorizes significant expenditures personally
  - Demonstrates surprising understanding of modern financial systems
- **Expenditure Patterns**: Predominantly funds three categories
  - Travel exploration (primary expenditure)
  - Historical acquisition (books, artifacts, information)
  - Observatory equipment (increasingly sophisticated)

### Historical Perspective

Godric's relationship with Atlantis reveals his unique temporal perspective:

- **Guardian Memory**: Recalls details of civilizations long considered mythical
  - Remembers Atlantis as a ward within his territory
  - Observed their rise, achievements, and eventual fall
  - Witnessed their attempts to hide treasures from his awareness
- **Temporal Distance**: Views 12,000 years as relatively recent history
  - Refers to Atlantean period as “not that long ago”
  - Casually references rulers and events from pre-historical periods
  - Occasionally forgets humans don't share his extended timeline
- **Historical Value**: Recognizes importance of preserving historical knowledge
  - Ensures artifacts reach appropriate scientific institutions
  - Provides context unavailable from any other source
  - Represents living connection to Earth's otherwise inaccessible past

> [!quote] Timeline Perspective
> “When asked about early Atlantean architecture, he described it as 'their awkward teenage phase' before they 'figured things out.' It's jarring to realize he's discussing a period around 14,000 BCE with the casual familiarity we might use for the 1990s.”
> —Dr. Ling Chen, Cultural Anthropology Division

## Grooming and Maintenance

Godric approaches personal grooming with the same meticulous attention he applies to all aspects of his “territory,” whether possessions, living space, or his own physical form. His routine reflects both practical considerations and his evolutionary advantages as Alpha Paramount.

### Hair Grooming

- **Initial State**: First discovered in human form with long hair
	- Maintained this length for about three months
	- Period represented experimental adaptation to having hair
- **First Adjustment**: Attempted a buzzcut after finding his long hair impractical
	- Madison intervened before he considered going bald
		- She found amusement in the fact that someone with scales now possessed hair. In practice, she just said it looked good and practical on him already.
- **Practical Phase**: Determined that short hair was most functional for daily activities
	- Also disliked the extremely short style of a buzzcut
	- Allowed gradual few inches of growth for versatility
- **Current Preference**: Short but sufficient length to style back.
	- Some strands occasionally fall across his forehead
		- Maria secretly found this charming
	- Plans future maintenance cut to a few centimeters longer than buzz cut

### Facial Hygiene

- **Management**: Maintains a clean-shaven appearance
	- Shaves regularly due to moderately rapid hair growth
	- Uses specialized reinforced razors after destroying previous ones
		- Prefers a classic safety razor or straight razor rather than an electric ones
			- Because they tend to break down on him
			- He also enjoys the practice
	- Achieves perfect precision through touch alone at his first try
		- Still sometimes uses mirrors for absolute perfection, also just to see how he looks. Moreso on the latter than the prior.
- **Body Hair Management**: Initially attempted complete body shaving
	- Lasted for a bout two months before he got sick of it, calling it an inefficient use of time.
	- Currently maintains a natural state except for his facial area
- **Preferences**: Adamantly refuses certain styles
	- Rejects all suggestions of any sort of mustache cultivation
	- Ignores both Maria and Madison's teasing about beard potential
		- For some reason the prior really wants to see him one. The answer is still no.
		- He remains unaffected by Maria's subtle hints

### Dental Hygiene

- **Maintenance Challenges**: Traditional brushing methods proved to be impractical
	- Resulted in destroyed toothbrushes
	- Eventually abandoned conventional dental hygiene procedures
- **Natural Properties**: Teeth maintain perfect condition without any intervention
	- Self-cleaning through passive sterilization
	- Immaculate appearance regardless of whatever he consumes or puts in his mouth
	- Regenerates, just like any part of his body, though they have never seen dental damage
- **Thermal Management**: His breath can be far too hot for non-Titans
	- Requires careful modulation of his energy
	- The reason why he himself advised most people to stay at a distance
	- Visible steam effect is emitted in cold environments
		- Is attempting to conceal this through improved energy modulation

## Psychology

Godric still perceives himself as *Godzilla* despite his human form. He cannot conceive himself as a potential romantic interest for any human who finds him attractive. Moreover, he considers the difference in lifespan and experience unbridgeable. He attempts to understand human attraction through the lens of territorial behavior as he cannot fathom why humans would find someone like him, an entirely different species, appealing.

This creates a magnificent misinterpretation where he accurately detects all physiological signs of attraction but completely miscategorizes their meaning:

| **Observed Human Behavior**            | **Godric's Interpretation**                      | **Actual Meaning**                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Prolonged eye contact                  | Dominance challenge or submission signal         | nterest and attraction                 |
| Nervous laughter                       | Stress vocalization due to predator presence     | Attraction-based nervousness           |
| Frequent proximity seeking             | Attempting to establish alliance with Alpha      | Desire for romantic/physical closeness |
| Competitive behavior when he's present | Resource competition for Alpha's attention       | Jealousy over romantic interest        |
| Gift-giving or offering assistance     | Tribute offering to establish favorable position | Flirtation and relationship building   |
| Physical appearance enhancement        | Status display to improve hierarchical standing  | Attempting to appear attractive        |

### The Maria Exception

The situation with Maria represents a unique blind spot:

- **Sensory Barrier**: Her reflective scales block his usual physiological reading ability
- **Deliberate Restraint**: His respect prevents him from attempting to penetrate this barrier
- **Trust Assumption**: Believes deep assessment unnecessary due to their ancient bond
- **Perfect Misinterpretation**: Misreads her attraction signals completely

### The Maria Exception

The situation with Maria represents a unique blind spot:

- **Sensory Barrier**: Her reflective scales block his usual physiological reading ability
- **Deliberate Restraint**: His respect prevents him from attempting to penetrate this barrier
- **Trust Assumption**: Believes deep assessment unnecessary due to their ancient bond
- **Perfect Misinterpretation**: Misreads her attraction signals completely

| Maria's Actual Behavior | Godric's Interpretation | Reality |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Lingering glances | Seeking connection with fellow ancient being | Romantic admiration |
| Staring at his chest | Noticing disorder requiring correction | Physical attraction |
| Distraction by undershirt | Continued concern about improper presentation | Finding the hint of hidden skin attractive |
| Attention to his clothing | Admiring her own craftsmanship | Admiring him wearing her creation |
| Preference for his stubbled appearance | Unknown cultural significance | Finding his rugged appearance attractive |

This creates a perfect parallel with Maria's own dilemma—she refuses to read his mind due to ethics and fear of rejection, while he cannot correctly interpret her signals due to species disconnect and sensory barriers.

## Relationship with Sleep

- Key concepts to understand:
	1. He does **not** require sleep
	2. He does **not** need to eat
	3. He does **not** need to hibernate
	4. He used sleep to improve the acclimation of his senses when he transformed into a human.
	5. His seasonal cycle was **only** implemented as a human
	6. He cuts down in the beginning of his active season
	7. He bulks up at the beginning of his dormant season, increasing his caloric intake
	8. He leaves instructions for Anguirus and Rodan as they take over together with Mothra and Kong

As a *Titanus gojira*, he does not require sleep nor conventional food to sustain himself. He can absorb solar radiation, geothermal radiation, and nuclear radiation to remain sated indefinitely. He also doesn't need the restorative effects of sleep due to his regeneration factor, which is also empowered during his intake of radiation. He consumes radiation, his regeneration quickens, he becomes sated, he continues to be awake; the cycle repeats.

As a Titan, creatures tend to assume that he sleeps when he lays down with his eyes closed. This is incorrect. All his senses remain acute and he can detect most things that happen to him: vibrations in the ground, scents in the air, sounds from the environment, and energy signatures pulsating across the world. His species have inherently heightened and refined senses; but, thanks to his age, this only improved substantially. What his usual species could detect from vast kilometers, he could do so across half the entire world. After his fight with Ghidorah, his senses only further improved. Something about the combination of Serizawa death by his gift of a nuke, stress from fighting the golden arsehole, and seeing Mothra die so soon after they've only just met in this period of time seemed to have exponentially developed his senses. His body appeared to have 'memorized' the experience, his species' inherent ability of limitless adaptation kicking in despite being under the impression that it was *only* due to Serizawa and Mothra that his growth was expedited. Those who think the Alpha Paramount is vulnerable in what appeared to be a sleeping position would be sorely mistaken.

Additionally, it is often mistaken that he requires hibernation. However, because winter is special for Northern *Titanus gojira* such as himself, they don't have a biological imperative for it. However, he eventually learned how to sleep for extended periods of time if he found a particular era boring. In this state, he remains in limbo between consciousness and not, a form of light sleep that can be stretched for millennia. If his senses pick up anything wrong,

As a human, his senses carried over. However, the sudden strain of experiencing the world in such vivid detail with a smaller body. Effectively, he was in shock most of the time. His body would eventually acclimate; he will always adapt after all. During his adjustment period though, he found respite in sleep, allowing him to cleanly processed the sensations he received from the environment. Overtime, the acuity and fidelity of his senses would return to the way he was used to, his body able to adjust thanks to the power of sleep.

His newfound appreciation of sleep produced an interesting pattern. He would remain active from December to August and then dormant from September to November. In his active season, he would appear leaner and more angular with a higher body temperature. In contrast, he is softer, rounder, his musculature less defined, and his body temperature lower. This is because when sleeping, he actually shifts to using what he had consumed rather than what he had absorbed. When he sleeps, he suspends the mechanism of his body converting radiation into energy. Thus, when he lets his consciousness dip in sleep, he is essentially relying on nutrients and minerals he had consumed. This gives him the bulkier appearance in this period. Once he wakes up, he begins cutting down any other fat still in him, returning him to his usual body weight.

Godric's favorite way to cut down fat is swimming. He'll swim for miles, sometimes even across continents. However, he'll eventually slim down as his body uses the fat as energy to fuel him. Fitness comes natural to him, which others might find unfair; he genuinely doesn't need to go to gym.

The reasoning behind the cycle's dates is simple. His dormant periods coincide with less human activity and he wakes up just in time for holidays.

# History

### Name History

- 6 months after the Antitheriomorphosis, Madison suggested that the Titans adopt human names.
	- This didn't go well for the current roster of Titans, namely Godzilla, Anguirus, Rodan, the Cardinal and Intercardinal Wardens.
		- Why would they need a human name? Are their names as it is not enough?
		- Humans were the ones to give their current names after all.
			- They didn't name themselves *Godzilla* or *Rodan* or *Anguirus* or *Scylla* or *Leviathan* or *Bakunawa* and so on…
			- Now they will make an attempt to change their names again? To add titles?
		- Madison retorted that that's precisely the point, now *they* get to decide what to name themselves.
	- The novel idea that the Titans themselves now get to choose how they will be called in the human tongue struck them true.
		- The first to possess a human name is Leviathan, forming *Nathan*.
			- *N*orth Levi*athan*
		- The second to follow was Scylla, who simply retained her name.
		- Then, the rest of the Cardinals and Intercardinals
		- It was actually Godzilla first who provided a name for himself.
			- Rodan and Anguirus clearly weren't ready yey, but perhaps seeing their leader might empower them to come forth soon enough.
- Madison presented him with a couple of names:
	- Should he be named after Serizawa?
	- Should he possess a Western or Eastern based name?
- Godzilla's solution was simple.
	- His approach would be both Western and Eastern:
		- For his Eastern approach:
			- The Titans who were turned into humans practically disappeared from public eye
			- For all intents and purposes, they were missing to the general public.
				- With the sole exception of Japan, from whose waters Godzilla's human form was found
					- Thus, Japan's government knows who Godzilla is.
						- Although as far as they are concerned, only Godzilla has turned into a human.
						- Nevertheless, Godzilla himself made them swear an oath never to leak that information to the public, lest he come and destroy the country.
			- In conclusion, he will remain *Gojira* (or *Godzilla*) to them.
				- But only to them and not the Japanese public
	- However, the idea of finally having a name for himself intrigued him.
		- His species was classified as *Titanus gojira*
			- He approved the name
		- There are four main factions of the species: North, South, East, and West
			- Godzilla, specifically was a *Northern Titanus gojira*
		- All *T. gojira* are patriarchal, though how by how much? That defers per race.
			- The North specifically are strictly patriarchal
		- It is thus common for names to be patrilineal
			- Typically, a son or daughter will have a name that goes like so:
			  -  *Son/Daughter of [Father]*
				  - Formally, this is how they are identified.
				  - Though rare, it is also valid to be named after their grandfathers
			  - Curiously, this means it is also common for sons to be juniors
		  - Godzilla's father was identified as Dagon
			  - After a bit of heartfelt reunion with his father's skeletal remains 3 months post-Antitheriomorphosis, as it is the skeleton that was excavated from the Philippines in 1999l; it is the same skeleton that housed two MUTOs, Godzilla was informed that he was designated as Dagon.
		  - This would mean that in the culture of the Northern Gojira, Godzilla would have the human-equivalent names:
			  1. Son of Dagon
			  2. Dagon Junior
			  3. Dagonson
			  - The aforementioned names would all be equally accepted in their culture
		  - Though he was finally shaken by the fact that his father did not abandon him, he felt guilty that he had cursed his name for literal eons.
			  - He did not feel like he deserved being named after his father
			  - Equally, he also wished to represent not just his own father but his entire race
		  - Thus, he figured that he would go as *Nordson*
			  - This name represents that he is what most Titans have actually often called him as ages ago: *The Last Son of the North* or *The Last Northerner*
			  - It wouldn't be until they interacted with ancient humans that he would gain the name Godzilla/Gojira
				  - The name would then stick, even with the Titans.
		  - For his first name, Madison presented him with a few choices:
			  - What caught Godzilla's eye was the name *Godric*
				  - An old Anglo-Saxon name that essentially meant *power of God* or the *ruler of God*
				  - It seemed apt for who he is, a representation of who he is
				  - Madison also thought it sounded regal
		  - Henceforth, he shall be known as Godric Nordson
