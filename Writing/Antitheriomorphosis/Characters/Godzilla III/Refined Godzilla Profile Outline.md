## Attire

### Daily

- **Color Palette**: The following colors are ordered according to preference
	1. Black
	2. White
	3. Charcoal gray
	4. Navy blues
	5. Forest greens
- **Clothing Material**: *All* clothing used to be breathable, flexible, durable, and comfortable materials but upon Mothra getting into the hobby of garment making, she personally replaced each of his clothes' material with her own silk.
	- Any other new clothes he would have are made with her silk, which is:
		- Supremely durable
			- Bulletproof and also proofed against other high-speed projectiles
			- Fireproof
			- Waterproof
			- Highly blast resistant
		- Highly flexible
			- He can comfortably fight in them
			- Returns to its original form if stretched
		- Easily maintainable
			- Mothra can simply repair it herself, and she produces unlimited silk
			- Cleaning it is just as effortless as typical dirt and stains do not cling to them
		- Can channel his atomic energy albeit limitedly
			- High energy output can compromise the integrity of the clothes
- **Clothing Style**: Simple, functional, form-fitting, and unembellished clothing that allows for mobility and agility
- **Shirts**: Nearly all of his shirts are long-sleeved button-downs
	- **Colors**: 40% white, 40% black, 10% grays, 9% navy blues, 1% forest greens
		- He only has **one** green shirt.
			- It came from a set of three, along with a blue and black shirt that was given to him
	- **Alternatives**: Possesses 10 plain form-fitting t-shirts and 3 henleys, one white and two black
		- Though they have been remade with Mothra's silk, he has never found use for them
			- *Can I throw these out?*
			- *Absolutely not, big guy—you have zero variety as it is!*
- **Underwear**:
	- **Undershirts**: Uses them from time to time as Mothra finds his chest hair distracting
		- Apparently, she is also distracted when she sees his undershirt peeking
			- *What does she even want at this point?!*
		- Now wears them whenever he feels like it, typically in winter so he isn't too obvious that he isn't cold
		- Comes in black and white
	- **Underpants**: Owns a variety of the following and *all* are black:
		- 70% boxer briefs, 15% midway briefs, 10% boxer shorts, 5% briefs
			- He only uses boxer shorts and briefs in his private quarters and when he is lounging
				- Of course no one but him knows this, but Mothra has observed such pattern
					- Funnily enough, it's the half-blind Baragon that was urged by Madison to detect, through his earth-sense, what each Titan's preferred underpants is.
						- She then wrote a paper that documented her findings with Baragon as her accomplice.
	- **Trousers**: Nearly every single pair of trousers he possesses are tactical pants but with vastly reduced amount of pockets
		- They appear nearly like formal trousers
			- He hates having too many pockets as they are too bulky and unnecessary
				- Anguirus/Alexios on the contrary likes pockets and makes up for both of them
					- Godzilla/Godric never asked for that but he appreciates the gesture
	- **Shorts**: Predominantly swimming trunks and are all black in color
		- He rarely uses them, even for their intended purpose, as his trousers are typically do the job

### Relationship with Sleep

- Key concepts to understand:
	1. He does **not** require sleep
	2. He does **not** need to eat
	3. He does **not** need to hibernate
	4. He used sleep to improve the acclimation of his senses when he transformed into a human.
	5. His seasonal cycle was **only** implemented as a human
	6. He cuts down in the beginning of his active season
	7. He bulks up at the beginning of his dormant season, increasing his caloric intake
	8. He leaves instructions for Anguirus and Rodan as they take over together with Mothra and Kong

As a *Titanus gojira*, he does not require sleep nor conventional food to sustain himself. He can absorb solar radiation, geothermal radiation, and nuclear radiation to remain sated indefinitely. He also doesn't need the restorative effects of sleep due to his regeneration factor, which is also empowered during his intake of radiation. He consumes radiation, his regeneration quickens, he becomes sated, he continues to be awake; the cycle repeats.

As a Titan, creatures tend to assume that he sleeps when he lays down with his eyes closed. This is incorrect. All his senses remain acute and he can detect most things that happen to him: vibrations in the ground, scents in the air, sounds from the environment, and energy signatures pulsating across the world. His species have inherently heightened and refined senses; but, thanks to his age, this only improved substantially. What his usual species could detect from vast kilometers, he could do so across half the entire world. After his fight with Ghidorah, his senses only further improved. Something about the combination of Serizawa death by his gift of a nuke, stress from fighting the golden arsehole, and seeing Mothra die so soon after they've only just met in this period of time seemed to have exponentially developed his senses. His body appeared to have 'memorized' the experience, his species' inherent ability of limitless adaptation kicking in despite being under the impression that it was *only* due to Serizawa and Mothra that his growth was expedited. Those who think the Alpha Paramount is vulnerable in what appeared to be a sleeping position would be sorely mistaken.

Additionally, it is often mistaken that he requires hibernation. However, because winter is special for Northern *Titanus gojira* such as himself, they don't have a biological imperative for it. However, he eventually learned how to sleep for extended periods of time if he found a particular era boring. In this state, he remains in limbo between consciousness and not, a form of light sleep that can be stretched for millennia. If his senses pick up anything wrong,

As a human, his senses carried over. However, the sudden strain of experiencing the world in such vivid detail with a smaller body. Effectively, he was in shock most of the time. His body would eventually acclimate; he will always adapt after all. During his adjustment period though, he found respite in sleep, allowing him to cleanly processed the sensations he received from the environment. Overtime, the acuity and fidelity of his senses would return to the way he was used to, his body able to adjust thanks to the power of sleep.

His newfound appreciation of sleep produced an interesting pattern. He would remain active from December to August and then dormant from September to November. In his active season, he would appear leaner and more angular with a higher body temperature. In contrast, he is softer, rounder, his musculature less defined, and his body temperature lower. This is because when sleeping, he actually shifts to using what he had consumed rather than what he had absorbed. When he sleeps, he suspends the mechanism of his body converting radiation into energy. Thus, when he lets his consciousness dip in sleep, he is essentially relying on nutrients and minerals he had consumed. This gives him the bulkier appearance in this period. Once he wakes up, he begins cutting down any other fat still in him, returning him to his usual body weight.

Godric's favorite way to cut down fat is swimming. He'll swim for miles, sometimes even across continents. However, he'll eventually slim down as his body uses the fat as energy to fuel him. Fitness comes natural to him, which others might find unfair; he genuinely doesn't need to go to gym.

The reasoning behind the cycle's dates is simple. His dormant periods coincide with less human activity and he wakes up just in time for holidays.

## History

## Name History

- 6 months after the Antitheriomorphosis, Madison suggested that the Titans adopt human names. 
	- This didn't go well for the current roster of Titans, namely Godzilla, Anguirus, Rodan, the Cardinal and Intercardinal Wardens.
		- Why would they need a human name? Are their names as it is not enough?
		- Humans were the ones to give their current names after all.
			- They didn't name themselves *Godzilla* or *Rodan* or *Anguirus* or *Scylla* or *Leviathan* or *Bakunawa* and so on...
			- Now they will make an attempt to change their names again? To add titles?
		- Madison retorted that that's precisely the point, now *they* get to decide what to name themselves. 
	- The novel idea that the Titans themselves now get to choose how they will be called in the human tongue struck them true.
		- The first to possess a human name is Leviathan, forming *Nathan*.
			- *N*orth Levi*athan* 
		- The second to follow was Scylla, who simply retained her name.
		- Then, the rest of the Cardinals and Intercardinals 
		- It was actually Godzilla first who provided a name for himself.
			- Rodan and Anguirus clearly weren't ready yey, but perhaps seeing their leader might empower them to come forth soon enough.
- Madison presented him with a couple of names:
	- Should he be named after Serizawa?
	- Should he possess a Western or Eastern based name?
- Godzilla's solution was simple. 
	- His approach would be both Western and Eastern:
		- For his Eastern approach:
			- The Titans who were turned into humans practically disappeared from public eye
			- For all intents and purposes, they were missing to the general public.
				- With the sole exception of Japan, from whose waters Godzilla's human form was found
					- Thus, Japan's government knows who Godzilla is.
						- Although as far as they are concerned, only Godzilla has turned into a human.
						- Nevertheless, Godzilla himself made them swear an oath never to leak that information to the public, lest he come and destroy the country.
			- In conclusion, he will remain *Gojira* (or *Godzilla*) to them.
				- But only to them and not the Japanese public
	- However, the idea of finally having a name for himself intrigued him.
		- His species was classified as *Titanus gojira*
			- He approved the name
		- There are four main factions of the species: North, South, East, and West
			- Godzilla, specifically was a *Northern Titanus gojira*
		- All *T. gojira* are patriarchal, though how by how much? That defers per race.
			- The North specifically are strictly patriarchal
		- It is thus common for names to be patrilineal
			- Typically, a son or daughter will have a name that goes like so:
			  -  *Son/Daughter of [Father]*
				  - Formally, this is how they are identified.
				  - Though rare, it is also valid to be named after their grandfathers
			  - Curiously, this means it is also common for sons to be juniors 
		  - Godzilla's father was identified as Dagon
			  - After a bit of heartfelt reunion with his father's skeletal remains 3 months post-Antitheriomorphosis, as it is the skeleton that was excavated from the Philippines in 1999l; it is the same skeleton that housed two MUTOs, Godzilla was informed that he was designated as Dagon.
		  - This would mean that in the culture of the Northern Gojira, Godzilla would have been named the following:
			  1. Son of Dagon
			  2. Dagon Junior
			  3. Dagonson
		  - The aforementioned names would all be equally accepted in their culture
		  - Though he was finally shaken by the fact that his father did not abandon him, he felt guilty that he had cursed his name for literal eons.
			  - He did not feel like he deserved being named after his father
			  - Equally, he also represented not just his own father but his entire race
		  - Thus, he figured that he would go as *Nordson*
			  - This name represents that he is what most Titans have actually often called him as ages ago: *The Last Son of the North* or *The Last Northerner*
			  - It wouldn't be until they interacted with ancient humans that he would gain the name Godzilla/Gojira
				  - The name would then stick, even with the Titans.
		  - For his first name, Madison presented him with a few choices:
			  - What caught Godzilla's eye was the name *Godric*
				  - An old Anglo-Saxon name that essentially meant *power of God* or the *ruler of God*
				  - It seemed apt for who he is, a representation of who he is
				  - Madison also thought it sounded regal
		  - Henceforth, he shall be known as Godric Nordson
