God, this is just gonna raise his stocks in the looks department. He's available in both nobel, regal flavor that can fit in a period movie and a thrilling, primal flavor that can fit in an action movie. His sexual appeal literally just rose through the roof with this LMFAOOOO

"If you could at least emote, you'd be a wonderful actor."

"Yeah, people will literally wet themselves all over you."

"If he could emote, that means we're dead."

## The Magic of Facial Hair

I particularly appreciate how even with just a stubble, perhaps if he just went a day without shaving, he already appears rugged. He genuinely disliked his long hair though, so he's never going back there again. Madison thinks it's because it's "too much hair" for someone who used to have none for a quarter of a billion years. 

Do you think we should modify some of his anatomical measurements and features to match this development? Personally, I think his hair, like his facial hair or head hair can do much of the work. 

I can imagine much like his bodily hair growing quickly then plateauing just as so could be a trait he has. It's just that it grows quicker and plateaus at a slower rate.

## Perfectly Weathered or Weathered Perfectly?

Maybe his skin, since we established it's slightly rough, can be one of this dual nature's manifestations. It's seemingly rough, as if by worked by the elements, yet we know his regenerative capabilities ensure his body remains good as new. Like maybe... subtle leather or perhaps it's seasoned? 

## European Blend

Another idea I have is that perhaps certain parts of his face can draw more Nordic/Germanic features, like the structure of his eyes or his jaw but his forehead still has this flat quality to it? 

After all, he is a Northern Titanus gojira. 
Though, it is not to say that a Northern European and a Northern Gojira are equivalent, but rather his human form was manifested with the closest human-equivalent possible to his true heritage as Titan, which are the Nordics or Germanics. One such example of this is his dark scale and dorsal fin coloration, which appear as a saturated black, translating into jet black or saturated black hair with very subtle blue undertones

The same Nordic, Germanic, Grecian, and Roman blend in his physique remains present though, but maybe his Nordic/Germanic features are just subtly more prominent than some, like a 25/25/25/25 split? He still looks like he can maintain a part-time job as a sculpture in an art museum, or appear as if he's a Roman emperor, but if people look at another angle, they see someone who can survive and thrive in the cold and depth of northern winters and seas. 

## Handymen Are Attractive Too?

It doesn't help the fact that he's supremely competent. He's capable of learning things quickly, has a penchant for being self-sufficent, and prefers the outdoors as much as possible. In fact, despite Castle Bravo being an underwater base prior to Battra's return to Earth, he preferred to be outside the base itself or he swam in the quiet of the night, where no people would see his usually half-naked self (God knows what would happen if people get just even a glimpse of that LMFAOOO). That private pool might be costly, Mark thinks, but if it prevents behaviors unfit for a professional scientific institution, then it's worth it!

## King of the Oblivious

And doesn't all of this just further increases his sexual appeal? I can already imagine the silly scenarios of an oblivious Godric navigating a world where people have this desire to throw themselves at them, only to suddenly back off as they realize they're in the midst of a super predator; suddenly, he's extra grateful for Mark initiating the idea to hide the existence of Antitheriomorphosized Titans. 

## Beneath Me

Also, Maria prefers him bearded, though she doesn't understand why. She likes it when he a peek of some strands of hair can be seen on his chest. She likes it when she can see a peek of his undershirt when the collar is also open.

Does she like the refined Godric, the rugged Godric, or... both? And why should she like him anyway! It should've been beneath her. This is just a distraction for their duties, a temptation no doubt.

It's not like he feels the same way...
