  - **Distribution**: 40% white, 40% black, 10% grays, 9% navy blues, 1% forest green (only one)

> —Godric and Madison on his idea of wardrobe variety

#### Undergarments

- **Undershirts**: Black or white variants, all plain
  - Wears periodically, especially in winter to appear affected by cold
- **Underpants**: All black, varied styles:
  - 70% boxer briefs, 15% midway briefs, 10% boxer shorts, 5% briefs
  - Boxer shorts and briefs reserved for private quarters

#### Lower Garments

- **Trousers**: Tactical pants with reduced pockets resembling formal trousers
  - Dislikes bulk and unnecessary pockets
- **Shorts**: Predominantly black swimming trunks, rarely used

### Formal Attire

#### Suits

- **Collection**: Six nearly identical suits, all made from Mothra's silk
  - 4 single-breasted suits (3 black, 1 charcoal gray)
  - 1 navy blue single-breasted (acquired after persistent pressure from Madison)
  - 1 black three-piece reserved exclusively for diplomatic functions
- **Style**: Classic cut with minimal detailing; slightly broader shoulders to accommodate his frame
- **Tailoring**: Perfect fit requiring no alterations; Mothra's silk naturally conforms to his proportions

#### Scale-Infused Garments

- **Appearance**: Carries almost identical texture to his scales, but softened by Mothra's silk
- **Properties**:
  - Creates microscopic energy veins visible only from centimeters away
  - Allows safer channeling of atomic energy without compromising integrity
  - **Regeneration**: If damaged, scales regenerate until filling out the silk framework
  - Limited supply restricts implementation to formal jackets and ties

> “I understand putting them in his suit jackets, but why would he put HIS OWN SCALES on TIES that HE DOESN'T EVEN WEAR?!”
> —Madison's exasperation with Godric's priorities

### Titan Court Regalia

Godric's ceremonial attire exists in two configurations, with only one able to be produced due to material limitations.

  - Creates commanding silhouette reminiscent of his Titan form
  - Side vents allow unrestricted combat movement
  - Typically worn unbuttoned
- **Vest**: Double-breasted with interconnected dorsal fin pattern
  - His favorite piece, occasionally worn with daily attire
  - Highest concentration of scales for maximum protection
  - Always buttoned, creating structured contrast to open jacket
- **Trousers**: Matches jacket in material and appearance
  - Higher flexibility in combat areas
  - Exceptionally flattering fit that has generated noticeable attention

#### Configuration Beta: Royal Doublet

- **Design**: Modernized doublet, exceptionally form-fitting and sleek
  - Flatters his physique while allowing full combat mobility
  - Bottom portion extends just below his rear, billowing slightly when belted
  - Tied closure at front rather than buttons by his preference
- **Materials**: Primarily constructed from his own shed scales and hide
  - Mothra's silk serves as the base framework
  - Scales concentrated at joints for reinforcement and flexibility
  - Texture resembles smooth, treated reptilian hide

### Madison's Ongoing Campaign

Madison has made numerous failed attempts to expand his wardrobe:
- A collection of colorful ties that remain in pristine condition, never worn
- Three dress shirts with subtle patterns that were “accidentally” destroyed during a “training incident”
- A tailored burgundy suit that mysteriously vanished (currently at the bottom of the Mariana Trench)
- A tuxedo that was reluctantly worn once for a Monarch gala before being “misplaced”
