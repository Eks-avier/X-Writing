This does fit! 

I like this awesome blend of refined ruggedness or rugged refinement that we have going here. He looks like he can be a Greek god all while living in a forest cabin with no one but himself. It really is no wonder he's so attractive. That amount of masculinity can be downright fatal for some people hahahaha

I also like the details about his private amenities. Let's discuss that as well. 

A month or so after January 2021, Mark had noticed that Godric has become a bit restless. No, it's all the Titans, with the sole exception of Maria who could fly as she pleased despite the absence of wings thanks to her powerful telekinesis—a fact that Rodan is incredibly jealous of as he has never relied on only his latent aerokinesis to fly. That's when it hit Mark: they want spaces of their own. They've been stuck in Castle Bravo for the majority of their human lives. Sure, they've gone to other countries as part of their "enrichment program" by Madison. Though, the fact of the matter is, while they have begun to have clothes and items of their own, they still don't have spaces that are truly theirs. They only have the rooms given to them—that isn't enough, clearly. Godric himself can only keep the others in line for so long since he himself is restless. And, it's precisely why Maria is unbothered as her essential need of being untethered still persists. Consider this interaction, one among many:

"This is so fucking ridiculous! Look at her."

"Can you stop squawking, Roman?! It's five in the damn morning..."

"She's flying like she doesn't have wings, Alexios. LOOK AT HER, ALEXIOS. She hasn't touched the fucking ground—has she even touched it at all?!"

"I GET IT!" snapped Alexios. After massaging his temples for a bit, he continued: "For Heaven's sake... I'm not blind, birdbrain," came the retort. "And she's always been capable of that; how do you think she hovers without flapping her wings?"

"There's this thing called air currents and gliding, you IDIO—"

"Oh yeah, because floating mid-air without so much as a breeze in sight is normal happenstance."

"Don't presume to think you know more about my own domain than me, Alexios."

A smile crept into Alex's normally reserved face, "And what would you know? You haven't touched your skies in quite a while."

"You asshole," Rodan lunged at his friend.

"Get your hands off me, you flaming twit—"

"That's enough," a deeper voice said, sounding far too exhausted for a being who could swim between continents with ease even as a human. "It's too early for your bickering."

Madison herself has described the deteriorating balance of some Titans as follow:

1. "Roman needs to get his beak sewn shut. S+ complainer, like a chicken who can't stop clucking or a raptor that can't stop squawking."
2. "Alexios has transformed into a snapping turtle. He either locks himself in his room or the slightest annoyance makes him irritated."
3. "Godric's one day away from nuking this place because of those two."

Madison, concerned suggested they go into another excursion. She had assumed they were simply tired from the "cramped" space, even though Castle Bravo was already a colossal facility. 

"Maybe we can go to the Maldives next?"

While she was sort of on the right track, it seemed there was something more profound that they're missing. 

"I don't think a vacation is what they need, let me deal with this."

Both Godric and Maria brought the situation to Mark. The former articulated that they require spaces and the latter emphasized the urgency. 

It starts, Mark soon realized, with accommodating Godric so he keeps everyone in line until everyone gets their own realms. So for the next month or two, Mark ordered that several facilities be made and done as soon as possible. It also helps that the Godric, Maria, and the other Titans were of great help. They would lift heavy material by themselves, offer precise adjustments, and in the case of Maria, allow the convenience of telekinesis and telepathy to aid them. It allowed for the first of Castle Bravo's major modifications to be implemented in beyond record time while also serving as an intermediary outlet for restlessness—Titans, as they realized, love work and they love it especially when it's about their territories. It's a foreshadowing to the collaboration of human and Titan on the Monster Island Palace that won't be even conceptualized until 2 years in the future.

His private pool is less of a pool and more of a way to exit Castle Bravo, allowing someone to end up outside in the Bermudian waters if they could swim deep enough into the hatch that leads to ourside the facility. This satisfies Godric's need for true natural waters while also providing him privacy. At day time, if he wants to swim, he can stay in this room and remain undisturbed. At night time, he can use it to exit the underwater base and explore the oceans. Only he can swim at night for vast distances, after all.

His private training room/gym (though he doesn't need one) is connected to this pool. Once again, only he is allowed access there... and maybe Maria, Alexios, Roman, Madison, and Mark on a good day. He often finds little use for it since his physique "rights itself naturally" and even though the equipment have been scaled, they're still not enough to satisfy as a challenge. He appreciates Mark's gesture of giving him one, nonetheless. Recently, he has tried conventional weight lifting, though not for the exercise itself—he found the movements reauired to them fascinating.

If he has no reason to be called by Monarch's upper management, then he has no need to exit these spaces, which includes his room (which is in the living areas of Castle Bravo, quite far away from his pool and gym), his pool, and his training room. 

His room is where he will typically be if he isn't at his pool. Either he's laying around like a cat in bed or floating like a tube on the pool or he's somewhere around the Bermuda.

This at least allows people some breathing room from him hahahaha. They get to function for a few hours normally without having to see his immaculate appearance and his overwhelming presence.

Madison often teases her dad that Serizawa would have been incredibly proud of what he done. For all his own doubts about his new position, Mark showed incredible intuition and initiative.

When I think about the tragedy of Godzilla, Mothra, and Battra. I seem to recall the words of Ishiro Honda, that monsters are tragic beings because they are born too tall, too strong; they aren't evil by choice. That's their tragedy.

And though they aren't evil in this AU - their capacity of certain forms of violence may at least make them appear to, they still remain far too "tall" and undeniably strong. 

In fact, becoming human has highlighted this even more! They're no longer "giant" monsters, but that same monstrosity still exists within. Their bodies have changed, but their essence remains.

No one embodies this tragedy more than Godzilla, Mothra, and Battra. One is divine from birth, perfect in every way; one possesses limitless potential and drive; and, while the other is clearly the most relatable of the three, Battra's aspiration and unflappable desire to reach the other remains just as inhuman as the others.

I think a future interaction with Battra and Mothra may occur. Perhaps they were quietly discussing, something rare due to their distance now. They talk of their past, painful as it is, and Battra says:

"I have chased you both for so long now. Every mystic art, every piece of knowledge, every connection I have mastered, acquired, and made was to serve my greatest desire of being apart of you both again. I was so sick of seeing you always ahead of me, always your backs against me. Even when we were young, the image of a larva and a lizard turned against me was always in front of me. A gap I didn't know or care before kept widening, and all I wanted was to be able to walk alongside you. I thought my attainment of magic could alleviate that, I thought my efforts to teach humanity could give me insight to reach you both - who by that time were so far ahead, looking at you two hurt. Then, when you exiled me, I thought I could use that time away to learn and practice. When I fought you two, I gave up the pretense of assisting the Xiliens because all I wanted was to prove I could not just stand alongside you, but beat you two... Damn, I was close... But the gap widened again. And now, all my effort seemed futile when he keeps getting stronger. The gap between you, him, and the rest of us has widened into an insurmountable degree. What am I supposed to do but to keep trying?" 

"It's hilarious... Of all our recent enemies, only you pushed Godric to those heights, only you pushed me to those heights. You kept using 'us' or 'we' as you if you have anything in common with humans or Titans. Have you perhaps realized that while you were so fixated on staring at our backs, on closing the gap between us three, that you were the closest being to do so? That everyone would be staring at your back and see the impossibility of reaching you? So focused on your envy that you couldn't stop and think just how far you've come. You chase and chase and chase. Aren't you tired? Look behind you."

A laugh escapes him. "I am much closer to them than I am to you."

"For one who could live and die countless of times, you see life as a mortal: immediate, never seeing the grander picture."

"Compared to you, I am nothing *but* a mortal. Compared to Godric, I am nothing *but* unskilled."

"And compared to everyone else?"

And for what was the first time in twelve thousand years since his exile, who for him would have been explicably longer as time dilated while travelling through the cosmos, they laughed at the absurdity of it all.

"I see you found yourselves a spot."

"And I see you're fashinably late as always."

"I did fell into your cavern, after all."

"And from then on made that life, and the rest, harder."

"But wouldn't you look at yourself? You're the greatest sorcerer of the universe now; I'm just Alpha Paramount, a title that means nothing to the cosmos except for everyone in this little rock."
