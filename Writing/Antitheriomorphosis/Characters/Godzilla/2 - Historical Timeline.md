# Godzilla: Historical Timeline

## Prehistoric Origins

### Parental Legacy

The story of Godzilla begins before his hatching, with parents who would shape his destiny:

#### Father (Dagon)

- **Appearance**:
    - Icy blue eyes contrasting with dark gray scales
    - Distinctive snow-white dorsal fins
    - Slightly wider build than his son would develop
- **Personality**:
    - Outwardly stoic but deeply affectionate
    - Claimed to hate looking at his son (not unkindly) as it reminded him of his mate
    - Despite this claim, never missed an opportunity to admire his offspring
    - Often described as “a horrible liar” by those who later learned his story
    - Protective and devoted single parent

#### Mother

- **Appearance**:
    - Golden eyes (rare trait among [[Northerner|Northerners]])
    - Obsidian scale coloration
    - Dark dorsal fin coloration
    - Smaller, thinner build than her mate
- **Legacy**:
    - Died while Godzilla was still in his egg
    - Killed defending her nest from [[MUTOs|MUTO]] attack
    - Never saw her son hatch or held him
    - Left lasting genetic imprint through his appearance
    - Memory preserved through Dagon's stories

### Birth & Early Years

- **Birth Period**: Approximately 250 million years ago
- **Species**: _[[Writing/Antitheriomorphosis/Titanus Gojira]]_, Northern race (Northerner)
- **Physical Inheritance**:
    - Father's visage and build (though slightly thinner and taller)
    - Father's dorsal fin shape
    - Mother's golden eyes
    - Mother's obsidian scale coloration
    - Mother's dorsal fin coloration
- **Initial Condition**:
    - Smaller than expected at hatching
    - Appeared to have weak constitution
    - Rare setback for _Titanus gojira_ but grew past it in his adulthood
    - Early challenge that demonstrated species' growth potential
    - Eventually developed into Earth's strongest being despite initial weakness
- **Early Development**:
    - Raised solely by father (Dagon)
    - Never knew mother except through father's stories
    - Learned survival skills in harsh Northern environment
    - Developed natural affinity for energy absorption and manipulation

### Father's Disappearance

A pivotal moment in young Godzilla's development came when his father ventured south:

- **Departure**: When Godzilla was approximately 10 years old, Dagon journeyed south seeking other _T. gojira_
- **True Fate**: Found Southern faction members parasitized by MUTOs, confronted MUTO Prime, and was defeated
- **Misinterpretation**: Young Godzilla believed his father had abandoned him due to inadequacy
- **Psychological Impact**: Created deep-seated insecurity despite growing power
- **Truth Discovery**: Only in recent times (2014 excavation) did Godzilla discover his father's skeleton
- **Emotional Resolution**: Learning that Dagon died protecting their species transformed Godzilla's understanding of his life

### Encountering the Twin Divine Moths

One of the most significant early events in Godzilla's life was his encounter with the Divine Moth twins:

- **First Meeting**: Young, injured Godzilla fleeing from Jinshin-Mushi predators found sanctuary in [[Mothra]] and [[Battra]]'s silk-lined cavern
- **Communication Challenge**: Initial interaction difficult due to language barriers
- **Telepathic Communion**: The twins established a mental link with the young Godzilla, in turn he taught them what he knew of his own race's language.
- **Intervention**: Battra had to temporarily paralyze the panicked young Godzilla with venom produced from his head horn.
- **Pact Formation**: Made a simple agreement in which Godzilla would show them the northern snows while the twins would show him the mysterious south
- **Relationship Foundation**: This childhood alliance marked the beginning of a trinity that would shape Earth's destiny

### Early Adventures with the Twin Divine Moths

The three young Titans explored Earth during its formative periods:

- **Protective Alliance**: Developed complementary defensive strategies
    - Divine Twins protected Godzilla from parasites
    - Godzilla defended twins from larger predators
- **Developmental Support**: Waited for each other during transformations and metamorphoses
- **Power Discovery**: Witnessed each other's first major power manifestations
- **Bond Formation**: Created foundation of trust that would endure despite later conflicts
- **Educational Exchange**: Shared knowledge of different environments and survival techniques

## Rise to Power

- **Unexpected Choice**: Deliberately grounded himself to experience their perspective
- **Integration Process**: Gradually became part of their partnership and treated both as his brothers
- **Role Development**: Evolved into providing perspective and levity to balance Godzilla's seriousness

## Ancient History

### The Divine Path Divergence

This period saw a significant development in the Divine Moths' powers, though their bond remained strong:

- **Divine Inheritance**: Mothra born with the soul of the Heavenly Instance
- **Battra's Path**: With Mothra's assistance, circumvented Divine Moth Covenant to gain magical aptitude while maintaining immortality
- **Shared Development**: The twins continued their close relationship despite their different divine paths
- **Trinity Continuation**: The original childhood bond between the three remained intact during this era

- **Memory Preservation**: Privately cherished memories of both twins who were there for him after his father disappeared
- **New Beginning**: Their relationship evolved significantly without Battra's influence

## Xilien Invasion (2023-2024)

### Invasion Context

The Xllien arrival represented a coordinated threat to Earth:

- **Initial Detection**: Identified alien presence and energy signatures
- **Strategic Response**: Coordinated Earth's Titans in defensive positions

## Historical Perspective & Memory

### Relationship to Time

Godzilla's longevity has shaped his perspective on history:

- **Temporal Context**: Witnessed entire span of human civilization as brief moment in his existence
- **Memory Capacity**: Perfect recall of events throughout his long life
- **Historical Detachment**: Views most historical events with relative emotional distance
- **Extinction Witness**: Observed numerous species rise and fall throughout Earth's history
- **Pattern Recognition**: Sees recurring cycles in planetary and species development
- **Long-Term Thinking**: Strategic considerations often span centuries rather than years
- **Perspective Sharing**: One of few beings capable of sharing firsthand knowledge with Mothra and Battra
- **Human Timeframe**: Considers entire human species as “modern” relative to his existence

> [!note] Temporal Perspective
> When humans discuss “ancient history” referring to events thousands of years ago, Godzilla experiences a profound disconnect - these events represent only the most recent fraction of his existence, equivalent to discussing what happened last week from a human perspective.
