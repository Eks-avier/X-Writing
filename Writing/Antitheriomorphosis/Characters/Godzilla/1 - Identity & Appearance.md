|   **Weight**    | 120 kg (unusually dense for his frame)                                                                                                                               |
|    **Build**    | Broad-shouldered with lean but extremely dense musculature                                                                                                           |
|    **Hair**     | Dark hair (color resembles his dorsal fins); typically styled back with some rebellious strands falling onto his forehead                                            |
| **Hair Length** | Prefers a shorter, dignified style; has experimented with shoulder length tied back                                                                                  |
| **Facial Hair** | Grew a beard during the Domestic Fantasy Arc after noticing Maria's preference; while he now prefers his bearded look, he still attempts to shave every now and then |
|    **Eyes**     | Golden when relaxed (rare maternal trait); usually appears light blue                                                                                                |

#### Eye Color Indicator

> [!note] Eye Color Indicator
> Godzilla's eye color serves as an emotional barometer:
>
> - **Light blue** - Vigilant (default state)
> - **Intensified blue** - Using powers or heightened emotions
> - **Dulled blue** - Fatigued
> - **Pulsating blue** - Agitated
> - **Golden** - Completely relaxed or deeply sad (rare)

#### Power Manifestation

When Godzilla uses his abilities, they manifest as energy effects rather than physical transformation:

- Bluish aura resembling Cherenkov radiation surrounds him during power use
- No physical titan features ever emerge
- His body temperature naturally runs higher than humans due to atomic energy
- When pushed to his absolute limits, veins of blue energy become visible beneath his skin

#### Distinctive Characteristics

- **Movement**: Unexpectedly graceful during combat despite his size, with perfect balance
- **Presence**: Radiates contained power - people instinctively move aside
- **Expression**: Generally stoic, with subtle micro-expressions
- **Voice**: Deep, resonant, seems to vibrate through the air
- **Impact**: Leaves deeper footprints than his weight would suggest; furniture creaks under him
- **Sunbathing**: Frequently sunbathes to efficiently absorb energy

### Seasonal Physique Changes

Godzilla's body undergoes subtle seasonal changes related to his hibernation cycle:

- **Active Season (December-August)**: Leaner physique (10-12% body fat)
    - More defined musculature and slightly more angular facial features
    - Higher body temperature and more pronounced energy aura
- **Pre-Hibernation (September-November)**: Bulking phase (15-18% body fat)
    - Fuller face with softer edges
    - Increased appetite and gradually slowing metabolism
    - Energy aura becomes more subdued

## Titan Form

> [!info] Titan Identity
>
> - **Species:** _[[Titanus gojira]]_
> - **Height:** 120 meters (394 feet)
> - **Weight:** 100,000 metric tonnes
> - **Status:** Dormant (due to Antitheriomorphosis)

### Physical Traits

- **Overall Appearance:** Immense, towering frame covered in thick, armor-like scales
- **Dorsal Fins:** Jagged and uneven, glow with energy, darker hue (inherited from mother)
- **Scales:** Thick and reinforced, obsidian gray complexion
- **Regeneration:** Bears no permanent scars due to species' regenerative capabilities

## Voice & Communication Style

### Core Qualities

- **Tone**: Deep, resonant baritone with incredible richness and clarity
- **Texture**: Velvety smooth with a natural gravitas that commands attention
- **Power**: Fills a room without raising volume; naturally commanding presence
- **Range**: Surprisingly dynamic for its depth, though rarely employed in public

### Accent Elements

- **Primary Foundation**: Transatlantic base with subtle Northern European influences
- **Distinctive Markers**:
    - Slightly harder consonants, particularly 't', 'k', and 'd' sounds
    - Precise, measured vowel pronunciations
    - Subtle rolling of certain 'r' sounds when relaxed or emotional
    - Occasionally unusual word stress patterns that hint at ancient origins

### Speech Patterns

- **Cadence**: Measured and deliberately paced; rarely rushes words
- **Pausing**: Strategic pauses before important points, creating natural emphasis
- **Economy**: Tendency toward precision and efficiency in word choice
- **Evolution**: Occasionally incorporates modern expressions, delivered with such gravitas they sound strangely formal

## Clothing & Presentation

### Daily Attire

- **Style**: Simple, functional clothing allowing easy movement; form-fitting, unembellished
- **Color Palette**: Black (favorite), white (secondary), charcoal grays, navy blues, deep forest greens
- **Shirts**: Predominantly plain button-downs (majority are black or white with occasional navy or deep green for “diversity”)
- **Undershirts**: Plain white or black t-shirts worn strictly as base layers, particularly in winter %% TO ADD: He doesn't really need to wear them, even in winter—it's just so people are less suspicious of him being unbothered by the cold. %%
- **Trousers**: Tactical or durable slacks with minimal pockets—finds too many bulky and unnecessary
- **Footwear**: Heavy-duty boots with good traction, built for long walks, climbing, and rough terrai
- **Accessories**: Simple wristband made of a scale from his Titan form; actively avoids jewelry or embellishments

#### Notable Refusals

- **Gloves**: Refuses to wear them as they interfere with his ability to manipulate atomic energy
- **Hats**: Despite Mothra making him an entire collection, he never wears them

### Titan Regalia

For ceremonial occasions as Alpha Paramount:

- **Upper Body**: Doublet made from his own shed scales and hide
    - Extremely form-fitting to maximize combat mobility
    - Lined with Mothra's silk for reinforcement while maintaining flexibility
    - Scales capture his ambient energy, creating subtle blue energy lines following dorsal fin patterns
- **Lower Body**: Often just wears his regular trousers for convenience
    - Has a matching lower set with a kilt-like translucent trailing element
    - When stationary during ceremonies, it provides subtle framing
    - In motion or wind, it billows behind him in a way that resembles his tail
- **Ceremonial Crown**: Made from the bones, scales, and dorsal fins of his fallen species
    - Four dorsal fins, each belonging to a different race of _Titanus gojira_ (North, South, East, West)
    - The fin representing the North is his father's, taken from excavated remains
    - **Significance**: Not a symbol of power or duty, but of loss and remembrance

## Hibernation Cycle & Sleep Patterns

### Historical Development

- **Ancient Pattern**: As a Titan, could remain continuously active for years during threats
- **Human Influence**: Developed regular sleep patterns after encountering ancient humans (Atlanteans)
- **Voluntary Choice**: Unlike true hibernation, his winter sleep is a behavioral pattern, not biological imperative
- **Era Skipping**: Has used extended hibernation to bypass uneventful periods like Ice Ages

### Current Pattern

- **Active Period**: December through August
- **Pre-Hibernation**: September through October (increasing lethargy)
- **Deep Hibernation**: November (true sleep state)
- **Post-Antitheriomorphosis Adaptation**: Human form requires more regular sleep
- **Domestic Fantasy Evolution**: During the Domestic Fantasy Arc, begins distributing sleep more evenly throughout the year

## Relationship with Identity

### Internal Experience

Godzilla's relationship with his human identity of “Godric Nordson” has evolved significantly:

- **Initial Phase**: Viewed human form as merely a temporary inconvenience
- **Integration Period**: Began incorporating human experiences into self-concept
- **Current Status**: Thinks of “Godric” as a genuine aspect of himself rather than just a cover
- **Maria Influence**: His relationship with Maria (Mothra) has significantly accelerated this integration
- **Name Recognition**: Responds equally to both “Godzilla” and “Godric” depending on context
- **Self-Perception**: Increasingly views himself as a singular being with multiple forms rather than separate identities

> [!important] Identity Evolution
> The Domestic Fantasy Arc marked a critical turning point in his identity integration. While initially maintaining rigid separation between “Godric” (cover identity) and “Godzilla” (true self), the extended time living as a human teacher with Maria as his partner led to genuine emotional attachment to his human experiences.
