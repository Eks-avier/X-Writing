### Human Appearance

#### 1. Facial Structure & Expression

- Sharp, striking features—his face is hawk-like, with angular cheekbones and a strong jawline.

- Fiery, deep-set eyes that glow faintly like embers, constantly flickering with intensity.

- A perpetually cocky smirk, as if he's always one step away from laughing at a bad idea and doing it anyway.

- When serious, his stare is piercing, carrying the unforgiving power of a volcano before eruption.

#### 2. Hair

- Wild, windswept, and untamed, as if the wind itself never leaves him alone.

- Deep red or dark auburn, reflecting the volcanic nature of his Titan form.

- Often messy and unkempt, though in a way that adds to his roguish charm.

- If he ever tries to tie it back, it won't last long—his energy is too restless.

#### 3. Build & Posture

- Lean but packed with explosive muscle, built for speed and aerial agility rather than brute strength.

- Every movement is fast, loose, and confident, like someone always ready to bolt or dive headfirst into danger.

- Tends to stand with a slight forward lean, as if he's always ready to take off.

- Posture is relaxed but never still—he shifts, gestures, or taps his fingers, a living embodiment of motion.

#### 4. Skin & Temperature

- Slightly warmer to the touch than normal humans, as if his body carries the heat of his volcanic origins.

- Tanned with a sun-kissed, ruddy undertone, as if he spends all his time soaring under the sun.

- When angry or excited, his body temperature rises, making the air around him uncomfortably warm.

#### 5. Clothing Style & Accessories

- Loose, lightweight clothing, designed for speed and freedom of movement—he hates feeling restricted.

- Sleeveless tops or open jackets, exposing his arms and shoulders like a fighter who thrives in movement.

- Warm, earthy colors—reds, oranges, browns—mirroring his volcanic essence.

- Occasionally wears a short cape or scarf, which flutters dramatically in the wind (because of course he would).

- Minimal jewelry, but if he does wear something, it's bold and fiery—a lava-stone pendant or something stolen from a past fight.
