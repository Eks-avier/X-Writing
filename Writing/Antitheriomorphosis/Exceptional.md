- A brief history on what a Null is
- A brief history on what Battra realized about Godzilla's species
- Battra opens an uninitialized singularity for the third time.
- Suddenly, Godzilla unleashes a pulse of nuclear energy sustained
- Battra marvels at how right his assertion was; their species has *infinite potential*
- Godzilla has been improving all throughout the fight
- Godzilla in the midst of fighting himself and Mothra suddenly appears before Battra and lands a **nasty** punch
- Godzilla uses Battra's copy of himself wielding an *Ever-changing Stone* against him by using it to *improve himself*. This allows him to gain a shortcut to optimizing his own control of Atomic Energy! Genius!

There was something so severely comedic to Battra about the fact that those who cannot even perceive, and thus comprehend, the realm of magic and sorcery are regarded as one of its most special subjects.

They were called the Null on Earth, because they were *nothing*. They were diseased and inferior. Their existence spit on the very foundations of the reality itself.

On hand, he *understands*. In the world of the Titans, survival is paramount; there can be no surviving against creatures capable of simply doing *more*. The Overenergy or the Flow is what allows for the Titans to rule this planet, so it is natural for those without it be under its boot. The Flow *is* what humans call Magic. The absence of that Flow within an entity signifies an inherent inferiority.

*Not Gojira*.

For Battra, their people's lack of natural connection to the Overenergy is a side-effect of their Divine nature. Divinity always trumps Magic,
