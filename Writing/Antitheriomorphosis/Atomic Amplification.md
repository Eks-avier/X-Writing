# Atomic Amplification

The Atomic Amplification is the first ability Godzilla developed post-Antitheriomorphosis.

It is inspired by two things:
1. The way Anguirus uses his natural damage absorption ability to empower himself.
2. Kong's fighting style that closely resembles human martial arts.

Godzilla's goal here is to create a way for him to fully utilize the unique human body to his advantage. When Amplified, he receives a boost to his entire physical body. HIs strength goes up, his physical defense goes up, his senses are boosted beyond their typical levels, his reaction speed goes up, his agility and speed goes up considerably. This allows Godzilla to approach combat in an entirely new direction. It has been so enjoyable to him, in fact, that prior to the Xilien Invasion, he has barely used his Atomic Breath and Nuclear Pulse—instead opting to utilize Atomic Amplification on top of his newfound unarmed close combat skills, which he developed thanks to Kong.

Atomic Amplification represents Godzilla's acceptance of the human body that he was unexpectedly forced into. It represents his growth as a character, from someone who relies on brute force and instinct to someone who integrates it with a more disciplined and precise approach. Atomic Amplification is the unification of his Titan and human self.

## Knowing Thyself

1. Godzilla sought ways to integrate his atomic energy into the martial arts demonstrated to him by Kong in their fight.
2. However, there were many limitations that he first has to acknowledge
3. *Titanus gojira* were masters of **projecting** energies out of their bodies.
	1. The most prominent example of this is the Atomic Breath
		1. They could use it with primal grace
		2. It is their ultimate and most signature weapon
		3. However, the human form constrained his control over this ability
			1. The range is inconsistent
			2. The output is inconsistent
				1. If it becomes too strong, it is painful to use
			3. The manner in which it manifests is inconsistent
				1. It sometimes appears as a cone
				2. It sometimes appear as the beam he has always used
			4. It becomes painful to use as well
				1. Sustaining it strains him
				2. Using it in general has become uncomfortable
4.  Unfortunately, *Titanus gojira* cannot manipulate their energy internally or externally.
	1. Their only method to internally manipulate energy is for *preparation* of the Atomic Breath
		1. They can only coalesce the energy necessary for the Atomic Breath
			1. They can build it up according to whatever output they desire
			2. This typically ends up changing how the energy ray manifests
				1. But, *Titanus gojira* has always used in in two 'modes'
					1. A quick burst
					2. A sustained beam
	2. They *seemingly* do not possess any method to manipulate their energies externally.
		1. They cannot 'steer' the direction in which their Atomic Breath travels; once it is fired, it will hit the area at which it was aimed.
		2. They cannot create any sort of energy constructs.
			1. This is in contrast to *Titanus mosura* who possess the ability to telekinetically shape their unique scales in however manner they please.
			2. This is in contrast to Titans who possess control over the elements like fire, water, air, and earth.
				1.  Rodan, who possesses aerokinesis and lithokinesis even as a Titan
					1. Though he rarely used them in favor of his wings.
				2. The Wardens, who are often masters of a specific elements
					1. Leviathan, Scylla, Manda, Bakunawa, and Amhuluk all have control over water
						1. The difference lie in how they utilize this
							1. Their style may be different
							2. Their domain of control is different
								1. Scylla, for example, can control any state of water but prefers using ice
								2. Leviathan utilizes all states of water, not preferring a single one
								3. Manda is an expert at pressurizing water to achieve piercing and slicing effects
									1. She's also more meticulous at controlling water.
								4. Bakunawa is a master of creating constructs out of water; no one is more detailed than him at creating various weapons, tools, and other constructs.
		3. They cannot freely wield energy out of their bodies nor even their emissions.
		4. *Titanus gojira* have no control of their energy, in whatever form or manner, once they leave their body.
	3. What *Titanus gojira* can do and have also excelled at is sensing any form of nuclear energy and radiation, which was needed to identify their sources
		1. This ability steadily improved across the ages.
			1. Godzilla even figured out how to expand his senses to other types of energies.
			2. This also lead to him figuring out how to expand his 'energy palate'
				1. This was crucial as radiation levels eventually waned and he had to seek others to sustain him before.
			3. As a human, this was one of his aspects that he had to adjust comprehensively
				1. His senses, especially his ability to sense energy and radiation, were dulled
					1. However, by the end of a month, he had reclaimed functional levels
					2. At half a year, he was back to normal
					3. By the beginning of 2021, he expanded his senses even more
						1. He became more precise in identifying types, sources, and radiation.
						2. Though his range of detection were still comparatively smaller.
5. These issues on internal and external control were said to be inherent limitations over their species' control over atomic energy
	1. A curious belief for the species most known to adapt and evolve through anything limitlessly
		1. Monarch believes this is the result of the Atomic Breath and sensing abilities being “enough” for the majority of their use cases.
	2. This also contradicts what Monarch now understands about Godzilla's atomic energy manipulation
		1. It is the *domination of energy*, the absolute subjugation of any and all forms of energy.
			1. They can sense, absorb, disperse, convert, nullify, and manipulate energy in whatever form or from whatever source.
		2. This working understanding of Godzilla's ability was posited by Battra himself after reincarnation from his death at the hands of his sister during the tail end of the Xilien Invasion.
6. Understanding these limitations proved to be crucial in knowing his current predicament and how to move past it.

## Conceiving the Concept

1. Godzilla and Kong went over many ideas for the integration project.
	1. First, they figured energy constructs. 
		1. Kong, a master of creating weapons from the environment on the spot, offered this idea.
		2. But, despite the considerable boost he gained from his Burning Form post-Ghidorah, he could not muster any sort of aptitude for it.
			1. Any attempts simply overheated his limbs.
			2. At worst, it caused a miniature explosion.
		3. Additionally, fighting with weapons isn't Godzilla's modus, even if he's considering a change in fighting style.
		4. In the end, it was a disaster.
	2. Then one day, his first breakthrough into the Atomic Amplification came in the form of the one and only Anguirus.
		1. Angu

Eventually, his first breakthrough came from the one and only Anguirus, one of his oldest and most loyal friends. Anguirus is ability is simple, he absorbs damage from any source. It is the inherent ability of his species, which was known for their fierce, protective, and unwavering nature. Underneath this tough ability is the hidden option to utilize the absorbed damage to empower physical constitution, allowing Anguirus to use his opponent's momentum against them, literally. This incredible ability is often overlooked due to its lack of flashiness. However, to those who are aware of and know how it works, it is a formidable ability fit for one and only Stalwart Vanguard, whose hardiness could only be matched by his unfailing loyalty to his brother-in-arms the King of the Monsters. Godzilla, inspired by Anguirus' empowerment ability, finally developed his intuition for the Atomic Amplification. Instead of relying on the external energy absorbed from an opponent to empower one's physical capabilities, like Anguirus's ability, Godzilla would utilize his own internal energy to achieve the same result himself. In a sense, Atomic Amplification is an homage to his brother-in-arms, a callback to their enduring relationship made manifest in the form of Godzilla's most favorite thing to do: combat. A shame it ended up as a catalyst for Anguirus' emotional spiral, because at this point in time, he was beginnning to be blinded by jealousy towards Kong, mistakenly interpreting the development of Godzilla's newest ability as a sign of moving on from him. To Anguirus, it's Kong who was the inspiration to Godzilla's Atomic Amplification.
