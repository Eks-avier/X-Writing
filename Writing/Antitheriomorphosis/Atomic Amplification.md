# Atomic Amplification

The Atomic Amplification is the first ability Godzilla developed post-Antitheriomorphosis.

It is inspired by two things:
1. The way Anguirus uses his natural damage absorption ability to empower himself.
2. Kong's fighting style that closely resembles human martial arts.

Godzilla's goal here is to create a way for him to fully utilize the unique human body to his advantage. When Amplified, he receives a boost to his entire physical body. HIs strength goes up, his physical defense goes up, his senses are boosted beyond their typical levels, his reaction speed goes up, his agility and speed goes up considerably. This allows Godzilla to approach combat in an entirely new direction. It has been so enjoyable to him, in fact, that prior to the Xilien Invasion, he has barely used his Atomic Breath and Nuclear Pulse—instead opting to utilize Atomic Amplification on top of his newfound unarmed close combat skills, which he developed thanks to Kong.

Atomic Amplification represents Godzilla's acceptance of the human body that he was unexpectedly forced into. It represents his growth as a character, from someone who relies on his instinctual understanding of his powers in order to brute force his way into solving problems to someone who integrates it with a more disciplined and precise approach. Atomic Amplification is the unification of his Titan and human self.

## Knowing Thyself

1. Godzilla sought ways to integrate his atomic energy into the martial arts demonstrated to him by Kong in their fight.
2. However, there were many limitations that he first has to acknowledge
3. *Titanus gojira* were masters of **projecting** energies out of their bodies.
	1. The most prominent example of this is the Atomic Breath
		1. They could use it with primal grace
		2. It is their ultimate and most signature weapon
		3. However, the human form constrained his control over this ability
			1. The range is inconsistent
			2. The output is inconsistent
				1. If it becomes too strong, it is painful to use
			3. The manner in which it manifests is inconsistent
				1. It sometimes appears as a cone
				2. It sometimes appear as the beam he has always used
			4. It becomes painful to use as well
				1. Sustaining it strains him
				2. Using it in general has become uncomfortable
4.  Unfortunately, *Titanus gojira* cannot manipulate their energy internally or externally.
	1. Their only method to internally manipulate energy is for *preparation* of the Atomic Breath
		1. They can only coalesce the energy necessary for the Atomic Breath
			1. They can build it up according to whatever output they desire
			2. This typically ends up changing how the energy ray manifests
				1. But, *Titanus gojira* has always used in in two 'modes'
					1. A quick burst
					2. A sustained beam
	2. They *seemingly* do not possess any method to manipulate their energies externally.
		1. They cannot 'steer' the direction in which their Atomic Breath travels; once it is fired, it will hit the area at which it was aimed.
		2. They cannot create any sort of energy constructs.
			1. This is in contrast to *Titanus mosura* who possess the ability to telekinetically shape their unique scales in however manner they please.
			2. This is in contrast to Titans who possess control over the elements like fire, water, air, and earth.
				1.  Rodan, who possesses aerokinesis and lithokinesis even as a Titan
					1. Though he rarely used them in favor of his wings.
				2. The Wardens, who are often masters of a specific elements
					1. Leviathan, Scylla, Manda, Bakunawa, and Amhuluk all have control over water
						1. The difference lie in how they utilize this
							1. Their style may be different
							2. Their domain of control is different
								1. Scylla, for example, can control any state of water but prefers using ice
								2. Leviathan utilizes all states of water, not preferring a single one
								3. Manda is an expert at pressurizing water to achieve piercing and slicing effects
									1. She's also more meticulous at controlling water.
								4. Bakunawa is a master of creating constructs out of water; no one is more detailed than him at creating various weapons, tools, and other constructs.
		3. They cannot freely wield energy out of their bodies nor even their emissions.
		4. *Titanus gojira* have no control of their energy, in whatever form or manner, once they leave their body.
	3. What *Titanus gojira* can do and have also excelled at is sensing any form of nuclear energy and radiation, which was needed to identify their sources
		1. This ability steadily improved across the ages.
			1. Godzilla even figured out how to expand his senses to other types of energies.
			2. This also lead to him figuring out how to expand his 'energy palate'
				1. This was crucial as radiation levels eventually waned and he had to seek others to sustain him before.
			3. As a human, this was one of his aspects that he had to adjust comprehensively
				1. His senses, especially his ability to sense energy and radiation, were dulled
					1. However, by the end of a month, he had reclaimed functional levels
					2. At half a year, he was back to normal
					3. By the beginning of 2021, he expanded his senses even more
						1. He became more precise in identifying types, sources, and radiation.
						2. Though his range of detection were still comparatively smaller.
5. These issues on internal and external control were said to be inherent limitations over their species' control over atomic energy
	1. A curious belief for the species most known to adapt and evolve through anything limitlessly
		1. Monarch believes this is the result of the Atomic Breath and sensing abilities being “enough” for the majority of their use cases.
	2. This also contradicts what Monarch now understands about Godzilla's atomic energy manipulation
		1. It is the *domination of energy*, the absolute subjugation of any and all forms of energy.
			1. They can sense, absorb, disperse, convert, nullify, and manipulate energy in whatever form or from whatever source.
		2. This working understanding of Godzilla's ability was posited by Battra himself after reincarnation from his death at the hands of his sister during the tail end of the Xilien Invasion.
6. Understanding these limitations proved to be crucial in knowing his current predicament and how to move past it.

## Conceiving the Concept

1. Once he understood clearly the limitations, conceiving the concept was now in order.
2. Godzilla and Kong went over many ideas for the integration project.
	1. First, they figured energy constructs. 
		1. Kong, a master of creating weapons from the environment on the spot, offered this idea.
		2. But, despite the considerable boost he gained from his Burning Form post-Ghidorah, he could not muster any sort of aptitude for it.
			1. Any attempts simply overheated his limbs.
			2. At worst, it caused a miniature explosion.
		3. Additionally, fighting with weapons isn't Godzilla's modus, even if he's considering a change in fighting style.
		4. In the end, it was a disaster.
3. Then one day, his first breakthrough into the Atomic Amplification came in the form of the one and only Anguirus and his damage absorption ability.
	1. The signature ability of*Titanus angilas* is simple: they can absorb any form of damage that comes in contact with them physically. 
	2. Underneath this remarkable defensive capability is the hidden option to utilize the damage absorbed as physical empowerment.
	3. This allows Anguirus to literally use an opponent's momentum against them.
		1. It also fits his fighting style: "A strong defense is a good offense".
	4. Unfortunately, it's often overlooked due to its lack of flashiness unlike the element manipulating Titans.
	5. To those who are aware and know of how it works, it is truly a formidable ability fit for the one and only Stalwart Vanguard, whose hardiness could only be matched by his unfailing loyalty to his greatest friend the King of the Monsters.
4. Anguirus' empowerment ability is what inspired Godzilla.
	1. If he cannot manipulate energy externally, then perhaps he can explore controlling his internal flow of energy.
		1. Instead of relying on absorbing energy from external sources, he would utilize his flow of energy to empower him!
5. The Atomic Amplification is an homage to his first brother-in-arms.
	1. It is a callback to a relationship that began all the way from the Mesozoic Era.
	2. It is a manifestation of his appreciation for his best friend in the form of the one thing Godzilla loves: fighting.
	3. It is a shame, though, that it ended up serving as a catalyst for Anguirus' jealousy towards Kong.
		1. At this point in time, he has noticed that the newly minted King of the Hollow Earth, the first Alpha Sovereign since Mothra herself, and the only one now since the title of Alpha Divine was formalized many eons ago. 
		2. To Anguirus, this ability only served as the representation of his impending replacement at the hands of Kong
6. Now, armed with the intuition of what he now calls the Atomic Amplification, he begins finding ways to feasibly manifest it.
	1. *Titanus gojira* cannot utilize their internal flow of energy to empower themselves.
		1. He must now go beyond the perceived limitations of his species and himself to achieve this.
	2. Kong made absolutely certain if he really can't create energy constructs and Godzilla simply violently exploded an arm in his face,

## The Prototype

1.  Prior to finalizing the Atomic Amplification, he and Kong created a sort of 'draft' of the ability which would serve as the foundation of the ability and also prove how dangerous it is when misused.
2. With some helpful lessons from some books and resources about human anatomy from Madison, the duo ended up with a way to actualize the ability.
3. Their brilliant idea ended up being the principle of the Atomic Amplification regardless of this "draft's" success.
	1. Since atomic energy circulates through out his body along with his blood, Kong pointed out that if he could consciously "control" this flow, then he may be closer to achieving the same effect as Anguirus's reinforcement. 
		1. The issue then became... how can one visualize controlling his own circulatory system?
		2. Kong was turned into a human at the same time large swathes of the Titan population did—in 2020.
			1. When he and Godzilla fought in 2022, Kong had done a little bit of exploring across the human world. 
				1. His experience as a bipedal Titan helped make the transition to human form nearly effortless.
				2. His only problem then was learning human speech and dealing with the perspective shift from being a giant monster to a tiny human.
				3. Kong's "disappearance" alarmed many of the Monarch operatives and scientists stationed at Skull Island. 
					1. It was the most important concern, superseding even Skull Island's imminent sinking after one of Ghidorah's generated storms merged with the island's perpetual storm cell.
					2. It became an ongoing mystery until Jia eventually revealed that Kong had left the island months ago, hitching a ride on one of Monarch's many vehicles with help from her and Dr. Ilene Andrews. 
						1. Jia urged him to go and explore the world beyond, to finally escape this island that had become a prison to him. 
							1. Kong promised to come back, but not until after he sought out a way to prevent Skull Island from sinking.
							2. Jia, knowing that this is impossible, allowed her father-figure to hold on to that hope.
					3. This event is parallel to the other Titan's adjustment period during 2020-2022.
					4. Kong eventually returned to a Skull Island that is barely holding on.
						1. In his travels, he encountered one of the Titans that the readers would eventually come to know as Manda, the Guardian of Mu and Northeastern Warden.
						2. Manda explained that there is nothing to be done now.
							1. The island had already degraded too much.
							2. The residents having migrated to the Hollow Earth.
							3. In a few months more, Skull Island will disappear from the face of the Earth.
							4. Kong despairs in the realization that memories of his childhood and parents would finally sink into the ocean's depths.
								1. Luckily, Monarch had moved the immaculately preserved remains of Kong's mother and father to safety—to Castle Bravo.
									1. Godzilla, now somewhat used to his human body by this time, was surprised to know that remnants of Kong's species still remained.
									2. As far as he was concerned, he dealt with the last of them after Skar King attempted to invade the surface world.
									3. Godzilla offers some history on  the Royal House of Kong, the gigantic apes
