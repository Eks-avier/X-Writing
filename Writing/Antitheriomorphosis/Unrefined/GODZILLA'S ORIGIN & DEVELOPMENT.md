# GODZILLA'S ORIGIN & DEVELOPMENT

### Early Years

- Born to last breeding pair of Northern T. gojira approximately 250 million years ago
- Mother died shortly after laying the egg , killed defending their cavern from MUTO attack
- Inherited rare golden eyes from mother (unusual Northern trait, comparable to human redheads)
- Raised solely by father (Dagon), who compressed traditional 15-year development timeline
- Initially smaller than typical Northern hatchlings, creating personal insecurity
- Struggled with atomic breath development, requiring tail-step intervention technique

### Father's Disappearance

- When Godzilla reached approximately age 10, Dagon journeyed south seeking other T. gojira
- Found only dead/infected Southern faction members being parasitized by MUTOs
- Confronted MUTO Prime (Jinshin-Mushi) and was defeated
- Became incubator for parasites that would emerge in 2014
- Never returned to his son

### Psychological Development

- Godzilla misinterpreted father's absence as abandonment due to his inadequacy
- Spent millions of years driven to prove worth through power and dominance
- Rose through Titan hierarchy faster than any other being, known as “Whirlwind of Death”
- Eventually reached point of existential questioning after achieving Alpha status
- Developed more measured leadership approach after “cooling period”

### The Truth Discovered

- Only recently (post-Antitheriomorphosis) discovered Dagon's skeleton at MONARCH facility
- Learned his father had died protecting the species rather than abandoning him
- This revelation fundamentally transformed his understanding of his life narrative
- Reconciliation with father's memory deeply influenced current leadership approach
- Explains his defense of Zilla Junior's decision to remain with species rather than accept Wardenship

### Current Psychological State

- Carries both parents with him symbolically—father's features, mother's eyes
- Has recreated traditional Northern family structure in Titan hierarchy
- Vow with Mothra unintentionally mirrors traditional Northern male/female domains
- Still grapples with incomplete understanding of “Directive of Heaven”
- Birthday (November 3) holds special significance
