# Godzilla's Regalia

### **Godzilla's Clothing & Titan Regalia**

Godzilla's clothing is built on **functionality, durability, and conservative practicality**, but his **Titan Regalia carries deep personal significance**. His attire reflects his **Northern heritage, his Titan identity, and his absolute prioritization of mobility over extravagance.**

While **most Titans splurge on their Titan Regalia**, Godzilla remains **minimalist**. Some Titans **toned down their own Regalia** over time, fearing they might **outshine their Alpha**, not realizing that **Godzilla doesn't care in the slightest.**

## **1. Daily Attire – Functional & Minimalist**

Godzilla's everyday clothing is **form-fitting, unembellished, and designed for unrestricted movement.**

### **Shirt:**

- **Long-sleeved button-downs**, durable and flexible.
- **Always fitted but never restrictive.**
- Keeps **the top button undone when lounging.**
- **Colors:**
  - **Black (favorite)**, **white (secondary)**, and occasionally **deep blue.**
  - Prefers solid colors—**no patterns, no embroidery, nothing unnecessary.**

### **Trousers:**

- **Tactical or durable slacks**, built for **comfort and endurance.**
- **Minimal pockets**—he finds too many **bulky and unnecessary.**
- Prefers **other methods of storage** over carrying things in his pants.

### **Footwear:**

- **Heavy-duty combat boots**, built for long walks, climbing, and rough terrain.

### **Accessories:**

- **None.** Actively avoids **jewelry, embellishments, or anything extra.**
- **Gloves?** He refuses. **Gloves interfere with his ability to manipulate atomic energy.**
- **Hats?** Mothra made him an entire collection. He **never** wears them.

## **2. Titan Regalia – “Official” Attire**

His **Titan Regalia** is for **ceremonial gatherings, battle, or when he must officially present himself as Alpha.** However, it is **still designed for maximum mobility.**

### **Tunic / Doublet:**

- Made from **his own shed scales and hide**, woven into a **durable yet flexible material.**
- Lined with **Mothra's silk for reinforcement,** but the **scales are what capture his ambient energy.**
- **Colors:**
  - **Black (default), white (occasional), deep blue (rare).**
  - The material **glows subtly when he does**, reacting to **his own energy.**

### **Trousers:**

- **Same as his daily slacks**—he does not believe in **ceremonial legwear.**
- **No excessive pockets.**

### **Cloak (Ceremonial Use Only):**

- **Suggested by Maddie Russell** for **purely aesthetic reasons.**
- **He tolerates it.**
- **Absolutely refuses to wear it in combat.**

### **Gloves (Ceremonial Use Only):**

- **Worn for tradition, not function.**
- **He hates them.**

### **Insignia & Energy Capture:**

- **No traditional insignia.**
- His **own dorsal fin fragments and scales serve as his identity.**
- **His regalia regenerates over time** due to the **self-repairing nature of his scales.**

### **Compared To Other Titans:**

- **Every other Titan Regalia looks more like a king's than Godzilla's.**
- **Most Titans originally made extravagant Regalia, but some toned theirs down out of fear of outshining Godzilla. The King in question does not understand what they're fussing about.** Godzilla does not care.

## **3. The Crown – The Weight of His People**

Unlike the **ceremonial crowns of kings**, Godzilla's is **a personal relic**, forged by his own hands.

### **Materials & Construction:**

- Made from **the bones, scales, and dorsal fins of his fallen species.**
- **Forged by Godzilla himself**—he learned to craft just for this.
- **Mothra's discarded scales are woven into it**, a detail **only she notices.**

### **Dorsal Fin Placement:**

- **Four dorsal fins**, each one **belonging to a different race of Titanus Gojira.**
- **North, South, East, and West**—a tribute to all that was lost.
- The fin that represents the North is not his but his father's, taken from his excavated remains from 2014

### **Significance & Meaning:**

- **Not a symbol of power.**
- **Not a symbol of duty.**
- **A symbol of loss.**
- **A weight he cannot yet carry fully.**
- **A reminder that he is the Last of his kind.**

### **His Attachment to It:**

- **People assumed he would dislike it.**
- **He often finds himself looking at it in the vault or playing with it.**
- **He often angles it under the light**, watching **Mothra's scales glow**, though he **does not know why.**

This crown is **not for others.**
**It is for him, for his people, and… for her.**
