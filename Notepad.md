# What Are Chants?

- A spell *is* an incantation and vice versa. To activate a spell, you need to *say* its incantation.
- A chant is often the same as an incantation! In fact, ancient human sorcerers use both interchangeably.
- For novices, incantations are needed. It helps them focus and visualize the spell.
- As sorcerers develop over the years, their incantations become shorter.
	- This is a *natural* optimization.
	- This is the prerequisite to the highly-sought after skill of *silent-spellcasting*.
- Incantations are *unique* to a sorcerer.
	- Two different students who learn the same spell from the same source from the same teacher can have two different incantations.
	- The teacher can provide his own incantation and the students learning from him can validly use it.
		- However, there is a chance that the spell may not work and nobody known why… until Battra.
			- *Anyone* who can perceive magic and has enough aptitude in it can learn any spell, the problem is the use of a standardized incantation.
			- This is why Battra teaches everything about a spell *except* its incantation.
				- Its name
				- How it works
				- Its result
				- Its use cases
				- This seems like choosing a function name for a function whose return type and body has been defined.
			- Battra lets the student develop his own incantation. “If you want to use that spell so badly, you decide how to envision it.”
- With Battra's era of sorcery came a new distinction between chants and incantations.
	- A chant is a shortened version of an incantation.
	- This allows one to *cut to the chase*.
	- A chant is now a way to optimize.

# Incantations, Chants, Optimizations, and Commitments

- Chants are shortened versions of incantations. In other words, chants are optimized incantations.
	- They may words taken from the incantation.
	- They may be key words that *evoke* a strong visualization in the caster.
- This marks the modern era of sorcery, where keywords or phrases are used instead of long, flowing poetry.
	- Both are still valid, in fact Battra uses them both as tools of optimization (it's an addiction for him). Only he so far can do that, so he instructs his students to pick a lane and stick to it.
	- The path to *silent spellcasting* is shortened.
- To understand how chants and incantations are used as optimization tools, one must understand how a spell's output is dependent on its activation.
	- If a spell is fully incanted, it will be casted with the full effect that a caster's level of mastery affords him.
	- This means that even if exhausted, one can choose to incantate or chant then cast a spell.
		- This is an implicit Contract, specifically a Self-Contract that works as follows: “I take the time and telegraph (by speaking or gesturing) my attack, but it will hit at maximum power.”
		- For example, if a healthy Sierra casts a fireball, it will take 1 second to cast and deal 100 damage. The more she gets tired and drained, it follows that her output will wane; her spell stability will be weaker; her casting speed lengthens, and so on. Her fireball will now take 5 seconds to cast and deal only 40 damage while also running the risk of it exploding on her face; or dissipating mid flight; or launching in another direction; and so on. If she uses her full incantation for her fireball, it returns to its prime state.
- A shorter chant would make the sorcerer take less time to talk, meaning he is less telegraphed while also keeping the buff to the spell provided that the sorcerer is successful in utilizing the chant.
	- However, extra care must be taken; you can't game the system. Visualization still remains king, if your chant doesn't evoke the image of the spell in your head, ***your spell fails***.

# Silent Spellcasting and Chants

- Silent spellcasting is a major goal if a sorcerer wishes to be in combat all the time.
- A common trade-off for silent spells is reduced output. This issue can be solved by simply more practice. Eventually, a silent spell will reach a regular incanted spell's output. It's a crowning glory for a sorcerer to have a silent spell at max output.
	- Almost all of Battra's spells and techniques are silent spells with max output.
- If a sorcerer can consistently cast spells, silently or regularly, at 100%, he might think he doesn't need chanting or incantations anymore.
	- WRONG! Because the same implicit Vow that surrounds a chant or incantation can still apply!
		- Battra has been disappointed by many a sorcerer in his exile for not knowing this simple fact!
		- In fact, they don't even know that you can chant to *increase* a spell's effectivity even when they're healthy! They don't use it! It drives him **mad**. Sorcerers don't need to wait till they're near death to use a chant!
	- In this sense, a chant is an overclocking mechanism, which you suggested and Battra wholeheartedly agrees.

# Pitfalls

**Chants and incantations must evoke a strong visualization within a caster's mind. When an incantation or chant is said, a sorcerer must be able to** ***see*** **the spell in their mind vividly.** Failure to do so will lead to a spell not even be casted in the first place.

# Elaborations - Chants

- Yes, there are different types of chants. Combat favors brevity while rituals favor elaboration.
- As long as the sorcerer visualizes the spell properly, such chants can be continuously optimized.
- While not Battra's style, yes sorcerer with strong instincts can shorten chants faster--he himself has mastered this too… it just reminds him too much of a Godzilla who knows sorcery--a horrifying thought.
- This is the idea of a standardized chant, but yes. Good luck matching Battra's precision and visualization though… He'd prefer you develop your own.

---

- Yes. Twin Cutters is an example of this. It is a spell formed via a Vow, but it has its own chant AND incantation that Battra utilizes to enhance it.
- Vows can do most anything, only the sorcerer's imagination is the limit. So yes, that scenario is possible.
- Absolutely yes. Such a setup can be even further optimized too. As long as a sorcerer is creative enough to think it, can visualize it clearly, and is capable of executing it. it will work.
- Battra has locked Chants on his spells, yes that's possible. It's an example of his absurd addiction to the game.

---

- This is what Battra ponders. He had to learn how to visualize perfectly, it's a learned skill for him. For someone like his sister or Godzilla… he prefers not to think about it lest his inferiority complex flares.
	- As long as sorcerers clearly visualize what they're doing and possess the control to execute it, then they can try as much as they like. Battra isn't a rigid teacher especially to beginners. It's his way of evaluating what they need and a way for the students to discover how fat they can go at their current state.
	- Yes, typically. Silent spellcasting is almost always weaker at first. Why it is weaker can be because of several reasons, but mostly due to the novelty of the skill or some silent adjustment to an aspect of the spell:
		- Some sorcerers might find it odd and thus needs readjusting and practice
		- Energy reserves might not be high enough as energy cost might have increased unexpectedly
		- Visualization might not be as clear if a spell is casted silently versus verbally
- This question is a matter of mastery. For beginners, of course a chanted spell is stronger. For those who can use silent spells, typically an incanted spell is stronger because for the most part they haven't matured it yet. For masters, it doesn't matter. For Battra, he can do nearly whatever he wants.
- No, the speech is part of the implicit Vow. However, *writing* a spell may do it. Would you like me to elaborate that?

---

- Yes. He's humanity's progenitor of sorcery. It would be him rectifying his mistake and learning from it, which he applies to the modern era.
	- For the cosmos, it is a revolutionary insight.
- Likely to find him absurd and insulting, but… he is in his own league so they reconsider.
- Yes, some reject them. Aliens might not have the same biology as us after all.
- Some sorcerers in the planets he has visited do consider it cheating.
	- Actually, it's why he assumes a complete human form despite evading the Antitheriomorphosis.
	- As a Titan, he uses another system--symbols through his wings (related to the *writing* idea I told you).

---

- The boost that could have gone into the chant simply does not take effect. This has something to do with the way Self-Commitments work. The consequences of breaking them or having them be disrupted is that you simply lose the bonus or effect you wanted out of the Self-Commitment.
- Battra knows a couple of forbidden spells that have forbidden chants and incantations.
- Yes, if the visualization is wrong, failure or undefined usually follows
- Being physically silenced is a great counter. It's up to the sorcerer to use his wits to get out of that situation.

# Elaborations - Battra's Wing-Written System

## Against Theft or Interference

His spells can be stolen or interfered with, you just have to be better than him to use it well. Some of them are hyper-optimized, you may have the pattern, the chants, the incantations, and whatever but do you visualize it like him? Do you possess the same control and efficiency? Magic can be stolen, but it can't be wielded by everyone at the same level as each other.
- They can, *theoretically*. You just have to avoid him noticing you're in his domains, which is impossible as he is aware of anyone and anything in his pocket universes. All his spells are *encrypted*, even if you were to find one in his domain, his domain is blank to anyone unless he makes them see it, you still have to figure it out. By that time he's right behind you.
- You *can* technically disrupt his call, but visually he's just gonna put his hand out into a portal and grab something, via hands, tentacles, silk threads, telekinesis, etc. Only opponents on his level can exploit that.4

## Pocket Universes in Combat

His pocket universes are a library of sorts, how it is inside I'm still trying to visualize it. Perhaps you can help me in that regard.
- He has all kinds of spells there, not just utility magic.
- He has to open it, find it, and get it. Good luck outspeeding him since every spell in his pocket universes are organized perfectly.
- If you can disrupt him, then good for you.
- These pocket universes are just areas of “dark matter”, which we now discussed as Primus floating off somewhere in the universe (actually, we can discuss this too, I'm not entirely sure of the concept). They're usually the size of a planet, but can be bigger. He can call them if he is forced into another realm.

## Scales + Wings

He can layer both, naturally. In his beginner days, it's a demanding skill; in the modern era, it isn't
- Indeed, via telekinesis or his own mist of scales, or internal mechanisms in his wings, he can inscribe new symbols mid-fight--he has to be careful not to ruin his other inscriptions though. It's an expression of mastery than a biological limit.

# Pocket Universes

- His pocket universes have security measures as well, although since Battra is aware of anything that happens in them, they just serve as surveillance.

## The Look

- I imagine that it has a giant tree in the middle with a massive light source in its center. Its branches represent each branch of magic and each fruit and leaf represents a spell under that branch.
	- Why this is what I thought, I don't know, but perhaps you can help with that.
	- This tree is also what connects his other pocket universes together.
	- It serves as the centrepoint, the stabilizer that ensures this pocket universes exist.
- Some of his pocket universes, of which there are 6, appear as actual libraries. This has been recently modernized since the Xillien Invasion and his reconciliation with other Titans of Earth.
	- Some say this is merely a part of Keep Charlie, but this is actually the pocket universe that Keep Charlie is in.
	- It's fitted with stronger security systems.
	- Eventually, Battra plans to give it to humans of Earth when the time comes.

### Further Exploration

- Battra doesn't have an infinite supply. In fact, he doesn't even have the most reserves. Yes, they are massive relative to the rest of the universe, but there are some who possess more than him. What is is truly his is his efficiency. He can bring a spell's energy cost to near 0. He loses less energy than he generates, giving him functionally infinite energy.
	- The passive energy he generates is funneled into the tree-like structure, where it is stored and powers the rest of the pocket universes.
	- The art of making these pocket universes require that the Primus this space is made of to act as the frame of that space, meaning it cannot be used as energy--it can be, but it collapses the entire space so it's pointless.
	- Much like humans can detect *dark matter* and *dark energy* surrounding baryonic matter, there's no reason for any intergalactic species to come across these pockets of Primus--in fact, it's abundant across the universe!
	- One has to learn the art of making them before they can be generated, at best most sorcerers make a clump of energy around them--useless.

# The Tree of Magic

- Originally I wanted something that fits his moth nature, but a tree always felt right. Now that you bring up Yggdrasil, it does make a whole lot of sense. It does make perfect sense for him.

## Access to Spells

- Each spell dangles from a branch. Battra forms a portal near it to get one. But this is the rawest, most straightforward way to do this. The tree isn't all too organized besides having spells under their respective branch.
- Battra instead uses another pocket universe. All the spells there appear as… whatever he wants really. Sometimes they're all orbs, if he's with students, he manifests them as books or scrolls. On default, they appear as transparent glowing orb. Upon touching this orb, a magical device, think of a script, immediately goes to the associating fruit/leaf and retrieves it for him. It is then transferred mentally to his head with everything he needs to know about it. It's like a hash map, where an orb is a key and a spell is its value.

  ---

Before I answer the rest of your final questions, let's discuss this first. If you have any questions from this, or you can help me refine this concept, share them. Then, after we can begin where we left off at that third bullet under #1 asking how Battra accesses spells in his tree.

---

- His loadout of spells depends on the situation he plans for. I imagine that he makes this a Vow, where he only possesses **ten** spells at a time but they are boosted by 150% of their output without any stability issues or energy cost increase.
	- He can discard or disable each spell, allowing him to ramp up the enhancement. He can exchange one for another, but he has to take note of the maximum limit that he can store--the Vow is only valid within the context of combat. He can't go over the limit, lest he loses the bonus.
	- I imagine this is something he does on default. He doesn't need his millions of spells.
	- Sometimes he can adjust how many he can have in turn for a weaker bonus.
		- He can have less spells in his arsenal but each are boosted by 175%.
		- He can have more, but each are boosted at 110%/
		- So on and so forth.
	- He's still finding a way to have 10 at 200%, but this one is point of improvement for him.

### Spell Retrieval

- If he literally plucks it, he has to put it back. If he uses his interface, he doesn't have to do that. There are only three situations where Battra deems it worthy to actually pluck the spell from the tree.
	- He wants to dispose of the spell.
	- He wants to give the spell to someone (this one is done rarely and is typically just ceremonial).
		- Since he's a psychic, he can just beam the information to their head; the joys of being a sorcerer and a natural psychic.
		- His other pocket universe can also just copy a spell, and then that's what he gives away.
	- He wants to modify a spell.
		 - His interface doesn't work for this--it's a read only interface, similar to C++ std::string_view.
			 - A string can be made from it via a copy; a string can be read from it.
			 - You cannot modify a string with it--illegal or undefined behaviour!
		- Modification requires that he literally change it the properties of the spell, so he has to pluck it and do it himself.
			- He's been looking to automize the process, but he quite like having a reason to look at the tree.
	- Spells can't decay or wilt or become obsolete.
	- Battra has forbidden spells, specifically those that target and interact with the soul. After his… horrid experience with that debacle, he just prefers having them for study and research.
	- To corrupt the tree, one has to access the tree; to access the tree, one has to get through the defense systems there; to get past the defense system, one has to get past Battra himself. It's more trouble that worth.
		- He does have to watch out with his interface so that it gives him the correct spell at the right time.
			- The retrieval must be quick
			- The beaming of information must be correct
			- Sometimes kinks in Primus, its inherently chaotic and unstable nature, can cause random glitches or bugs. The system is self-correcting and sustaining so it cleans itself up.
				- Otherwise, Battra himself fixes it, he's notified of it anyway since he's aware of everything there.
- The tree has no will, it's just a fancy storage area for him
- Battra relies on his interface that he built to search it. It's equivalent to a search engine that relies on the fact that all his spells are perfectly organized and categorized.
	- His retrieval system is not similar to an AI. It's at best a program that does what it is told to do.

# Spellkeeping

- This entire process of storing, organizing, categorizing, and making spells easy to access is the art of Spellkeeping--this is why if you remember the outline I did that features Sierra, there are Spellkeeping courses.

## Specializing Pocket Universes

- I… actually, beyond the main one and the spell interface, as well as Keep Charlie. I still have 3 more pocket universes for Battra to develop.
	- You can help me with that.
- Battra has actually already detached Keep Charlie when he made it. He only holds on to it since most of his students don't know how to maintain it, but when they do, it's theirs entirely.
- As much as he loves his students, it's important they function without him. He can't always ne around them after all.

---

# Combat Arena

## Accessibility

- Students and researchers are allowed as long as they have Battra's permission.
	- Keep Charlie features a smaller version of this, but unlike Battra's own where some functionalities are unavailable: mainly the areas where one can experiment on the living and the dead, it possesses complete parity with Battra's version.
		- In fact, some students have requested even more amenities and features--it may very well have more features than Battra's own version soon.
- Simulations are typically an enemy. In Battra's version… live copies are used… how he got these are… quite unethical.
	- In Keep Charlie, these are instead replaced with bots produced by Monarch and modified by the students--it's part of their many projects.
- The arena can be adjusted in difficulty. ESP students often cooperate to connect the facility in a psychic link to ensure everything is synchronized with the sorcerers-in-training's current level.
	- For the ESP students, this also serves as an academic activity.
	- For Battra's level, it is naturally attuned to his level.

## Battle Simulations & Tactical Applications

- Battra simulates opponents that are based on his memory of them.
	- He “pours” his memory into the pocket universe, unlike the version in Keep Charlie where everything is student-managed.
- Godzilla, Ghidorah, Mothra, and other opponents relative to him are hard to simulate--they're vastly unpredictable in nature. He still tries though. But there's something about his fellow Alpha-level Titans that is so hard to predict and simulate.
- He can prepare for hypothetical opponents and worst-case scenarios, it keeps him on his toes.

## Limitations & Counterplay

- Enemies can malfunction if his memory of them is incomplete--everything is based on his memory so that's up to him.
	- For the version in Keep Charlie, it can definitely malfunction through the technology used there and the students' own inexperience.
- Wounds inflicted are real. Battra can heal himself so it doesn't matter. As for the students' version, it's up to them to figure that out.
	- Healing stations were developed just outside of the facility to mitigate this.
- Only the student area in Keep Charlie can be hacked--doing so is incredibly difficult however.
	- One has to get past Keep Charlie's own defensive system and the students themselves.
	- Battra's is impossible, seeing as only he has access to it and offenders need to get past him first.

---

# The Archive

1. Battra puts most of his drafts of RP Spells here
2. His research on the soul.
	- Ideally he would have had those rogue sorcerers's spells on the soul here; but since Mothra erased their existence from everyone but either of them, they are now lost.
3. His spells on time manipulation
4. There are not sealed here forever, but rather stuff that is unstable and illegal. Access to them still remain, he just doesn't use them.
5. He uses the spells here for manipulating time within barriers or for exploring the soul--he barely knows much about them till today.
6. Most of his RP Spells, he's still afraid to use them. They're highly unstable, practically unusable due to their undefined behavior, and since it's made of Raw Primus, he'd rather not bring them out in the open.
7. The Archive is the most protected of his pocket universes.
	- If he doesn't use it for a set amount of time, he forgets it. To enter it, he must go through the Tree where the memory of what it is and how to open it is stored.
	- To use most of the spells here would require master level at minimum.
8. All knowledge must be preserved, that's what he believes.
9. Mothra would definitely disapprove of his research into the soul. There are some things that should not be comprehended.
10. Battra and another entity holds most of the universe's secrets, ensuring that none of them are ever forgotten or lost.
	- He meets up with the entity every couple hundred thousand to million of years.
	- I actually don't have a name for this entity, but we can conceptualize that later. Just remember we need one.

Oh this is amazing…

It really sounds like an issue Roman should fix because he's the light hearted one, the fun one, the one who sees things from the sky…

But should anything *even* be fixed? Godric is… content more than ever… He and Anguirus' truest older brother now finally having a glimpse of a stress-free life… Well, as stress free as the Alpha Paramount is supposed to be… But still! Godric is *happier*.

*And maybe it means he has a chance with Maria if Godric is preoccupied with his new friendship*. But he buried that thought so deep in his mind, no psionic will be able to bring it out. He will not destroy their quartet because he has a.. a *crush* on Maria.

So… No Ghidorah and no more invasion. What should he do exactly?

The problem was in 2022, when Godzilla heard an Alpha call being so brazenly emitted. He went there, sought it out and a day later… he changed. The stoic and all-powerful brother he's always known has changed. The other 2 blamed Kong but Roman knows that kind of change, has had that change when he regained his ability to fly again.

Sure, to other humans literally nothing happened… But to the 3 of them, there's a lightness in his eyes, even if they're blue. There's a reignited flame burning inside Godric burning bright in spite of Ghidorah making every attempt to snuff it out.

So why should he ruin it? *It gets him closer to Maria too*.

*Why can't Roman shut up about her…*

So… With any problem, he assesses. There have been distinct changes with Godzilla.

One was with Kong and one with Battra.

The former is the apparently the problem but the latter was not… Why?

Because even Battra is on Alex's and Maria's side in this issue.

“I've always assumed he got his obsidian scale coloration from his father… He never mentioned such things even as a hatchling…” He had said, barging into a conversation uninvited.

In fact, he even mentioned that the fighting style of Godzilla during their fight was *different*, unlike anything he had known his oldest friend by.

Godzilla has always been defined by the way he fights. It's the way his species expressed themselves.

Battra confided in them a part of his fight. The way Godzilla laughed, filled with euphoria. The way his energy efficiency shot to godlike levels, the way his hits began hitting harder by the second. Each attack was sharper, each Atomic Railgun threatened to hit him had he not been able to teleport. Each spell he endured.

When faced with Godzilla's true potential, Battra was horrified.

But then he knew that Kong had brought out that same reaction from Godzilla… and Battra wondered if the way Kong reacted fueled Godzilla's change.

If so… then Kong also confused Battra. And just like that was a part of the club. Battra did make sure he will say nothing to Godzilla about their little forum.

However, when Alex and Maria fled, leaving behind Roman and Barth… there was something Roman noticed… Amusement in his eyes.

Roman wondered if it had something to do with the way Battra's twin sister felt vulnerable. Man, those twins  really need to reconcile.

But back to Kong…

The guy's barely a century old… and yet… he seems to be closer than Anguirus, closer than… Mothra. That seems to just add to the greater insult. Heaven, it's just so so wrong to say. Wrong to say anyone could be closer to Godzilla than Roman, Alex, or Maria—and even Battra.

And, yes, Roman has seen the throne room. Heavens there might be something worse than a volcano that will erupt if the other 2 saw that.

Kong will share a space with Mothra AND Anguirus for Godzilla? Yeah… nuh-uh.

He wants to do something to fix this *mess*. Anything…

But… visions of Mothra, beautiful and light and everything that was nice, appear often his head like flakes of obsidian stuck in his ear after sleeping in a volcano… and he stops because why he can't act *right*.

Ugh, why does this all have to be so difficult for the four of them? This is worse than Ghidorah, worse than chasing down parasites  or hearing endless territorial dispute.

Could the four of them be really undone by one giant monkey? Preposterous…

Someone needs to *do* something.

Perhaps a Madison Russel would?
