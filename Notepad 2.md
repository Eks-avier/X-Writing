# Notepad 2

These are good options, and I agree with your recommendations with the sole exception of 2 for I don't know how to feel about the shadow organization appearing this early.

The perspective of this chapter is through Stella, who is the younger twin. 

My intention for chapter 1 is based on two things:
1. Bakunawa's rampage in the form of the storm raging; vivid images of rain, lightning, thunder, howling winds, and the destruction of buildings and buildings; the complete darkness
2. Stella's traumatic psychic awakening, the vivid experience of seeing life through another person's eyes: reading their thoughts and feelings. This is further compounded that she repeatedly read their final thoughts as people died around her.

Some elements I also want expressed:
1. Hearing Ghidorah's call, his roar echoing around the world; I want a particularly haunting description from Stella about that
2. Hearing Godzilla's call, his roar echoing around the world; I also want a chilling description from Stella about that
3. The contrast between Ghidorah and Godzilla
4. The suddenness of Bakunawa's emergence. He came from Visayas, yet his storm reached the entire Philippines.
5. I had a mistake about the sunny afternoon before . Considering Ghidorah at this point was in Mexico about to issue his awakening call (as per KOTM), he already had generated several storms generated all throughout the world. Bakunawa simply strengthened this with his own power.
6. The fact this took several hours. Allow me to highlight:
   1. Godzilla had to first be injured from the oxygen destroyer
   2. Ghidorah's call to awaken the Titans 
   3. Mothra emerging from her cocoon, her imago form revealed (along with the psionic pulse unleashed)
   4. Mothra had to reveal herself finally to Castle Bravo, unleashing her God Rays (which I also think should affect all the way to the Philippines but likely just a flash of light in the sky or a psionic connection)
   5. Serizawa had to sacrifice himself
   6. Maddie had to survive a bit as Ghidorah rampaged through Boston
   7. Godzilla arriving
   8. Something in between as Rodan wouldn't be fighting Mothra (this will be a modified KOTM which I still haven't a clue how to structure)
   9. Godzilla and King Ghidorah fighting
   10. Mothra sacrificing herself
   11. Burning Godzilla
   12. King Ghidorah's defeat
   13. THEN and only then will Godzilla issue the call for every awakened Titan to stand down.
7. As you see, there is A LOT OF TIME to invest in the first chapter purely being a disaster thriller from the eyes of a newly-awakened psychic being assaulted by thoughts and emotions of people dying, getting injured, or their fear and shock.

Finally, during the opening scene with the Balagtas family, I'm considering the scenario:
- Stella and Sierra just finished school and were on the way to the mall with family as a little treat. Suddenly, she felt a pain in her head (the psionic pulse reaching her) then a horrible roar reverberating across the sky (Ghidorah's call). In a few moments, the storm began to slowly grow in strength. 
- TVs suddenly began showing breaking news, live coverage from other countries about a roar heard across the world, then the immediate following of environmental anomalies: 
	- In Arizona, everything was frozen in the span of a few seconds for several miles and a winter storm unlike any other manifested (Scylla)
	- Areas in East Asia experiencing rain that can 'cut' as if the water itself was pressurized, each droplet a knife falling down (Manda)
	- Northern Europe suffering a winter storm unlike any other, entire regions freezing almost instantly, waters threatening to consume many islands, some already gone (Leviathan)
	- From the sky, both Arizona and bordering states as well as Northern Europe look unnaturally white a cause of snow and ice.
	- The entire state of New Jersey is not only experiencing a storm (one of many by Ghidorah) but also a complete outage of electricity and EMP so strong it began affecting the environment (Barb, the MUTO Queen)
	- In Germany, earthquakes suddenly began with plants beginning to "walk" or move in an unnatural ways (Methuselah)
	- Every country in seemingly every continent reported of the same picture: a giant monster awakening and then causing destruction
	- Suddenly, even that live coverage got cut as the *Malacanang* issued alarms everywhere. Suddenly, broadcast on a shore in Visayas filled every TV: a powerful shaking of the ground in the area, then a groan, then a giant dragon rose gracefully and roared: Bakunawa has risen from the depths.

What do you think of these changes?

Ah, this brought me to another topic about him that's marginally tangential to this.

Godric is actually quite modest in clothing! 

At first, Madison thought it's because he doesn't want to reveal his physique (she's one of the first people who saw him post-Antitheriomorphosis, she knows what he looks like). This is why she often teased him: that the Alpha Paramount is surprisingly modest with clothing. 

*You know, big guy. Lots of men with your status and physique would love to walk around revealing some muscle here and there. Try some t-shirts, at least. Besides, it's not like we could stop you.*

*I have no need of them*

All his clothes are long-sleeved, he doesn't wear jackets though (*Should I? It's not cold.*). He never wears shorts, even casual settings. Most especially in casual settings, he practically dresses the same 

*Is there a distinction? I remain clothed after all; and no, I do not feel warm in them.*

The behavior is jarring enough that the upper echelon of Monarch, including Maddie, began to find it... odd. 

*Madison, can you stop urging the King of the Monsters to act like a damn thirst trapper.*

*Dad, I'm not telling him to treat base hallways as a fashion ramp in Mr. Universe; I'm just curious why he's not wearing literally anything else*

The most people get out of him every other week or so are sleeves rolled up slightly, likely to not get them dirty. They were raised just below the forearm, high enough to reveal it 

*Maddie, please don't tell me that this technician fainted because of Godric and not the heat...*

*One of them, and I quote, said "I want him to choke me."*

Maddie found this entire thing odd, Mothra's silk is quite possibly the best clothing material in the entire world. Breathable, seemingly indestructible, flexible,  and the worst stains washed off it like hot butter on a pan. Heck, half of her wardrobe's custom made from the Queen of the Monsters. The bonus is that she has direct connection to their maker and that they're endlessly customizable. 

She's also very modest too, which is fair. Maria Lepidiel doesn't strike her as someone that enjoys flaunting ph

However, when Godric suddenly popped a top button on his shirt. Madison swore she saw someone fall over (*Are we seriously acting like this in a professional setting? Christ...*). She noticed some of the hair visible on his chest (*Weird, guess he got tired shaving his body*). More curious is that he sometimes wears an undershirt (*How the hell is he wearing just an undershirt in fucking winter*?) She found lots of staff loved that too. 

But instead of attraction (why should she? He's more like the big brother she never had), Madison developed an increasing curiosity. 

Several theories were raised, aided my his father and some of the fellow core staff of Monarch:
1. *Are you serious? If I were thirsted over by even a fraction like that, I'd be cocooning myself* — Dr. Stanton
2. *Perhaps,  it's because he misses his protective scales?* — Dr. (Ilene) Chen
3. *Or maybe it's none of our business* — Dr. Russell
