# Psionic Abilities 

Psionic abilities are extremely simple in comparison to sorcery, hinging on two abilities: telekinesis and telepathy.

While sorcery requires practitioners with souls capable of Soul Infusion, all psionics require only a powerful brain. This disparity makes psychic abilities far more commonplace in the universe than sorcery. 

For unexplainable reasons, species that are both capable of psionics and sorcery are so unbelievably rare in the universe that they are often said to be non-existent. Having one species capable of both is special, having two already puts that planet at a great cosmic advantage, but having *many* is borderline mythical. Earth stands among the very, very few planets across the known universe capable of housing *many* psionic-sorcerers.
