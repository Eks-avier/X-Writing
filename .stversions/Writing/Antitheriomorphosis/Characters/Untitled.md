# Anguirus's Unique Three-Name Identity

## The Final Selection: Alexios Leonidas Peltast

### Breaking Tradition... Appropriately

While other Titans adopted simpler human identities, Anguirus's naming process took a unique turn that perfectly reflected his character. Much like his unwavering loyalty stands apart from other Titans' more fluid allegiances, his human identity would likewise be distinctive - more formal, more structured, and carrying deeper historical weight.

### The Three-Name Structure

- **First Name: Alexios**
  - Maintains the "A" pattern consistent with "Anguirus"
  - Greek origin meaning "defender" or "helper" - precisely his role
  - Carries military connotations in Greek history
  - Provides the simple "Alex" for everyday use

- **Middle Name: Leonidas**
  - Honors the Spartan king who embodied loyalty unto death
  - Creates connection to the warrior culture that mirrors his values
  - Serves as his "formal" name in official ceremonies
  - Used by Godzilla in rare moments of public acknowledgment

- **Last Name: Peltast**
  - References the shield-bearing soldiers of ancient Greece
  - Symbolizes his protective function in Godzilla's court
  - Reflects his carapace without being obvious
  - Completes the cultural reference with military precision

### Usage Patterns

This three-part name serves different functions in different contexts:

- **Everyday Monarch Operations:** "Alex Peltast"
- **Military Coordination:** "Major Peltast"
- **Formal Court Ceremonies:** "Alexios Leonidas Peltast"
- **Casual Settings:** Simply "Alex"
- **Godzilla's Rare Formal Address:** "Leonidas" (used only in the most significant moments)
- **Security Clearance Documentation:** "A.L. Peltast"

### The Only Titan with Three Names

The uniqueness of his triple-name structure became a point of subtle pride for Anguirus. Where others chose simplicity, his identity carried additional weight and formality - much like his approach to duty itself.

Madison noted in her files:
> "It's perfect that Anguirus would be the only Titan with three names. It's exactly how he approaches everything - with additional care, formality, and attention to detail. The three-name structure feels almost military in its precision, like a full rank and title. It stands apart from the others while still connecting through the 'A' initial. When I suggested preserving that pattern, his immediate response was a single approving nod."

## Titan Reactions to the Three-Name Exception

- **Godzilla:** Appreciated the formality as befitting his most trusted lieutenant
- **Mothra:** Noted it reflected his "additional layer of commitment to structure"
- **Kong:** Simply stated "He earns the extra name"
- **Rodan:** Tried to claim he too should have three names, was immediately denied
- **Battra:** "Trust Anguirus to require additional paperwork even in his identity"

## The Name in Documentation

Monarch administrative staff initially attempted to standardize his name to a simpler format on forms, but quickly abandoned the effort after receiving a systematic, multi-page explanation of why the three-part structure was necessary for proper identification, complete with historical references and precedents from military history.

The incident became known as "The Naming Memo" and is now part of Monarch orientation materials as an example of "knowing when to adapt procedures rather than enforce standardization."

## The Special Case Clause

Officially, Monarch documentation now includes a specific exception clause for Anguirus:
> "In recognition of specialized military designation conventions, A.L. Peltast shall be recorded with full three-part nomenclature in all official records."

The exception itself is perfectly structured, formal, and meticulously detailed - just like the Titan it serves.
