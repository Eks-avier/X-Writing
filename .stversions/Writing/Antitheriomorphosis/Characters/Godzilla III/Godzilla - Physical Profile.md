    - Represents direct physical evidence of pre-historical advanced civilization
- **Distribution System**: Transfers artifacts to Monarch for museum placement
    - Items loaned rather than sold to maintain ownership
    - Generous compensation negotiated by Monarch on his behalf
    - Funds directed to personal accounts for discretionary use
- **Financial Scale**: Revenue sufficient to fund “several generations”
    - Maintains complete independence from Monarch financial support
    - Covers all personal expenses including vehicle maintenance and travel
    - Accumulates substantial reserves for future contingencies

> [!quote] Historical Irony
> “They would wave treasures in front of my snout thinking I wouldn't see or remember them. How odd that now they are the ones forgotten.” —Godric, regarding Atlantean artifacts

### Financial Management Approach

Despite delegating administration, Godric maintains characteristic oversight:

- **Delegation Parameters**: Clear boundaries for Monarch financial management
    - Handles fundamental paperwork and regulatory compliance

    - Travel exploration (primary expenditure)
    - Historical acquisition (books, artifacts, information)
    - Observatory equipment (increasingly sophisticated)

## Scale-Silk Material Properties

The integration of Godzilla's shed scales and hide with Mothra's silk creates a remarkable composite material used in his regalia and select formal attire:

- **Durability**: Nigh-indestructible under conventional stress
    - Resistant to ballistic impacts, energy weapons, and extreme temperatures
    - Maintains integrity even when exposed to corrosive substances
    - Self-repairs minor damages within hours using ambient radiation
- **Weight**: Possesses an almost comical lightness despite its density
    - Feels no heavier than standard cotton clothing
    - Creates no additional burden even during extended combat
    - Allows for full range of motion without resistance

### Energy Conductivity Limitations

- **Current Capacity**: Safely conducts approximately 40% of Godric's full energy output
    - Beyond this threshold, garment integrity begins to deteriorate
    - Represents a substantial improvement over standard materials which fail at 5-10%
- **Limiting Factors**:
    - Godric's current control precision (primary limitation)
    - Available quantity of shed scales and hide (secondary limitation)
    - Distribution density throughout the garment (tertiary limitation)
- **Practical Impact**: Limited conductive capacity rarely becomes problematic
    - Few situations require energy output exceeding 40% threshold
    - In extreme circumstances, garment preservation remains low priority

> [!quote] Material Limitations
> “It's not the suit I'm worried about if I ever need to channel more than forty percent.” —Godric, when questioned about the limitations of his regalia
