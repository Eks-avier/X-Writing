## Physical Appearance

### Facial & Body Structure

- **Face**: Square with defined jawline, high cheekbones, strong brow ridge
- **Proportions**: Unnervingly perfect anatomical symmetry and golden ratio alignment
- **Build**: Dense musculature with seasonal variation (10-12% body fat Dec-Aug, 15-18% Sep-Nov)
- **Hair**: Black, short but long enough to style back; occasional fallen strands across forehead
  - Has experimented with shoulder-length tied back
- **Eyes**: Dual-natured
  - **Primary (visible)**: Light blue, luminous with atomic energy; almost always active
  - **True (rarely seen)**: Gold, maternal inheritance, concealed by energy output
- **Skin**: Caucasian with slight sun-exposure tan; entirely unblemished
- **Body Hair**: Modest growth on chest, arms, legs after abandoning initial shaving routine
- **Perception**: Often appears older than documented age due to regal bearing

### Movement & Presence

- **Gait**: Economical, tactical, and perfectly balanced despite imposing stature
- **Posture**: Flawless military bearing maintained subconsciously; never bows or looks up/down
  - Compels taller people to look down and shorter people to look up
- **Stillness**: Capable of perfect motionlessness during observation periods
- **Presence**: Passively triggers fight/flight responses in humans:
  - Subconscious cowering
  - Area abandonment without conscious reason
  - Freezing with elevated sweat response
- **Temperature**: Notably elevated body heat, most apparent during winter months
- **Habits**: Regular sunbathing for both recreation and solar energy absorption

### Voice & Speech

- **Tone**: Deep resonant baritone with natural room-filling projection
- **Quality**: Velvety smooth with effortless gravitas
- **Pattern**: Deliberately measured pace; economical word selection
- **Impact**: Commands attention without effort or volume
- **Style**: Natural emphasis on important points; never rushes words

## Attire Preferences

### Color Hierarchy (Descending preference)

1. Black (primary)
2. White
3. Charcoal gray
4. Navy blue
5. Forest green (single shirt only)

### Material & Construction

- **Primary Material**: Mothra-silk replacing all previous fabrics
  - Bulletproof, fireproof, waterproof, blast-resistant
  - Highly flexible with perfect shape memory
  - Limited atomic energy channeling capability
  - Effortless maintenance (no stain adherence)
- **Style**: Simple, functional, form-fitting, unembellished

### Daily Wardrobe

- **Shirts**: Long-sleeved button-downs (40% white, 40% black, 10% gray, 9% navy, 1% green)
- **Trousers**: Modified tactical pants with minimal pockets, resembling formal wear
  - Contrasts with Anguirus who maximizes pocket capacity
- **Underwear**: Predominantly black boxer briefs (70%); boxer shorts and briefs reserved for private quarters
  - Became subject of Madison's research paper with Baragon's earth-sense detection
- **Undershirts**: Worn intermittently, particularly when Mothra finds chest hair “distracting”
  - Paradoxically, she's equally distracted by visible undershirt edges
- **Shorts**: Predominantly black swimming trunks, rarely used
  - Indifferent to water drag: “*Drag? I care not.*”

## Physiological Cycles

### Seasonal Variations

- **Active Season (Dec-Aug)**
  - 10-12% body fat
  - Defined musculature
  - Angular facial features
  - Elevated body temperature
  - Primary activity phase
  - Coincides with major human holidays
- **Dormant Period (Sep-Nov)**
  - 15-18% body fat
  - Softer musculature
  - Rounded facial features
  - Reduced body temperature
  - Primarily sleep-focused
  - Period of reduced human activity

### Sleep Relationship

- **Natural State**: Requires no sleep or conventional food
  - Sustains on solar, geothermal, and nuclear radiation
  - Regeneration factor eliminates need for restorative sleep
  - Can remain in limbo between consciousness and sleep for millennia
- **Sensory Acuity**: Maintains environmental awareness even when appearing to sleep
  - Can detect vibrations, scents, sounds, and energy signatures globally
  - Senses exponentially improved after Ghidorah battle
- **Human Adaptation**: Sleep became necessary post-transformation
  - Used to process sensory overload from human form's concentrated input
  - Gradually acclimated to human sensory experience
  - Voluntarily maintains sleep cycle for leadership rotation
- **Recovery Method**: Swimming preferred for post-dormancy reconditioning
  - Swims continental distances during transition to active season
  - Natural fitness requires no conventional exercise regime

## Name History

### Selection Process

- Adopted human name 6 months after Antitheriomorphosis
- Madison Russell initiated Titan naming project
  - Initially met with resistance from all Titans
  - Reframed as Titans choosing their own names rather than having names imposed
- Leviathan (Nathan) was first to adopt a human name
  - Derived from “North” and “Leviathan”
- Godzilla was first among main Titans to select a name

### Cultural Foundations

- **Eastern Component**: Maintains “Gojira/Godzilla” with Japanese government
  - Japan aware of his human form as it was discovered in their waters
  - Sworn to secrecy under threat of destruction
- **Western Component**: Created “Godric Nordson” for broader use
  - First name “Godric”: Anglo-Saxon meaning “power of God” or “ruler of God”
  - Last name “Nordson”: References his status as “Last Son of the North”

### Patrilineal Considerations

- Northern *Titanus gojira* follow strict patrilineal naming
  - Sons traditionally named after fathers: “Son of [Father]”
  - Father identified as “Dagon” from Philippines skeletal remains
  - Could have been “Son of Dagon,” “Dagon Junior,” or “Dagonson”
- Rejected paternal name due to guilt over centuries of resentment
  - Chose to represent entire northern lineage instead of just his father
