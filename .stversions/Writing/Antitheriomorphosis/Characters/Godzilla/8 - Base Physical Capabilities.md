# Base Physical Capabilities

## Overview

Even without accessing his energy manipulation powers, Godzilla possesses extraordinary physical capabilities far beyond human limitations. His Antitheriomorphosis-transformed body maintains the core physical traits that made him apex among Titans, though scaled to human proportions. These capabilities form the foundation upon which his more specialized powers build.

## Strength

### Raw Power Output

- **Baseline Level**: Capable of lifting approximately 30-40 tons without energy enhancement
- **Force Generation**: Punches can shatter reinforced concrete and bend steel
- **Grip Strength**: Can crush titanium alloys with bare hands
- **Structural Integrity**: Body capable of exerting maximum force without self-injury
- **Limitation**: Despite tremendous strength, still constrained by human form's leverage points
- **Proportional Reduction**: Significantly “weaker” than Titan form relative to body size, with much of his power redistributed to his Amplified state

### Practical Applications

- **Combat Utility**: Single strikes can incapacitate lesser Titans in human form
- **Environmental Interaction**: Can tear through most human-made barriers with minimal effort
- **Restraint Ability**: Has developed precise control to handle delicate objects without damage
- **Adaptations**: Learned to compensate for human body's different center of gravity and leverage

### Notable Feats

- **Structural Impact**: Left hand imprint in reinforced concrete wall during early adaptation phase
- **Combat Application**: Immobilized Kong briefly with single arm lock during their first human-form sparring
- **Restraint Demonstration**: Gradually learned to control strength enough to use standard drinking glasses

> [!note] Strength Distribution
> Unlike humans whose strength concentrates in specific muscle groups, Godzilla's strength is evenly distributed throughout his body, making even casual movements potentially devastating if not carefully controlled.

## Durability

### Damage Resistance

- **Comparative Ranking**: Second only to Anguirus at base level due to the latter's specialized damage absorption
- **Impact Resistance**: Can withstand forces that would kill normal humans instantly
- **Crushing Protection**: Internal structure maintains integrity under extreme pressure
- **Penetration Defense**: Skin significantly more resistant to cutting and piercing than human tissue
- **Environmental Immunity**: Largely unaffected by temperature extremes and atmospheric pressure changes
- **Energy Absorption**: Can absorb significant kinetic energy without injury
- **Amplified Supremacy**: When using Atomic Amplification, surpasses even Anguirus's durability

### Internal Resilience

- **Organ Protection**: Critical organs surrounded by denser tissue than normal humans
- **Skeletal Reinforcement**: Bone density approximately 10x human average
- **Muscle Composition**: Fiber structure allows greater tension and compression without tearing
- **Systemic Redundancy**: Multiple backup systems for critical biological functions

### Recovery Capacity

- **Baseline Recovery**: Even without active regeneration, heals approximately 50x faster than humans
- **Stamina Reserve**: Can maintain peak physical exertion for days without rest
- **Toxin Resistance**: Complete immunity to all known poisons, venoms, and pathogenic threats
- **Biological Sterilization**: His naturally radioactive body chemistry renders him immune to diseases
- **Pain Tolerance**: Extraordinarily high threshold allowing continued function despite catastrophic injury
  - Can withstand impalement through vital organs
  - Remains combat-effective after limb loss
  - Functions normally with multiple penetrating wounds
  - Often responds to severe injuries with apparent amusement
  - Limits unknown as no injury has yet triggered incapacitation through pain alone

- **Vulnerability Window**: Brief period of heightened vulnerability during intensive regeneration

## Radiation Effects

### Biological Hazards

- **Body Fluids**: All bodily fluids contain potentially lethal levels of radiation
  - Sweat, saliva, blood, urine, and other excretions are toxic to unprotected humans
  - Reproductive fluids particularly dangerous due to concentrated energy
  - Physical intimacy with non-radiation-adapted beings potentially fatal
- **Proximity Effects**: Extended close contact can cause radiation sickness in humans
- **Control Capability**: Can modulate radiation output to reduce ambient danger
  - Lowest emission levels during relaxed states (golden eyes)
  - Highest levels during combat or Amplification (intense blue eyes)
  - Never completely radiation-free, merely reduced to “safer” levels

### Environmental Impact

- **Ambient Sterilization**: Extended presence in an area reduces microbial activity
- **Plant Adaptation**: Extended exposure causes plant life to either die or develop radiation resistance
- **Water Effects**: Can render water sources temporarily radioactive through prolonged contact
- **Trace Elements**: Leaves detectable radiation signature that fades over time

## Agility

### Movement Capability

- **Future Development**: Continues refining balance between strength and skill

### Sensory Management

- **Initial Overload**: Early post-transformation period marked by sensory hypersensitivity
- **Filtering Development**: Learned to manage vast sensory input without distraction
- **Focus Techniques**: Can now selectively enhance or reduce specific sensory channels
- **Integration Status**: Seamlessly processes multi-sensory information at all times
- **Post-Invasion Improvement**: No longer experiences occasional sensory overload following the Xillien Invasion
  - Either through optimization of neural pathways
  - Or significantly increased threshold for overload
  - Still prefers quiet spaces due to personal preference rather than necessity

## “The Zone” State Impact

Following his battle with Battra during the Xillien Invasion, Godzilla's physical capabilities underwent significant enhancement:

- **Physiological Memory**: Body “remembered” the perfect optimization achieved during “The Zone”
- **Baseline Enhancement**: All physical attributes improved by approximately 150%
- **Neural Adaptation**: Brain structure permanently altered to better process sensory information
- **Potential Ceiling**: Current abilities represent only a fraction of what is possible if he enters “The Zone” again
- **Theoretical Limits**: Unknown, as each achievement of “The Zone” state may create further physiological improvements
- **Current Status**: Has not intentionally attempted to re-enter “The Zone” since the Battra conflict
