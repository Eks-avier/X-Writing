## Overview

Blaine Richmond Carter is a highly skilled Marine currently assigned to Monarch. He has extensive combat experience, having served in multiple deployments, including the [[Xillien Invasion]]. Originally from Texas, he grew up on a ranch with his family, including his six-year-old sister.
