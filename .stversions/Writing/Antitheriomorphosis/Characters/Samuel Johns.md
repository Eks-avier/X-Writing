# **Samuel Johns**

## Profile

- Age: 20
- Affiliation: [[Monarch]], ESP Division
- Status: Active Student
- Location: [[Castle Bravo]]

## Overview

Samuel Johns is a purely telepathic student in Monarch's ESP Division, specializing in psychic abilities such as mind linking and psychic projection. He is one of only a few individuals capable of projecting his consciousness at a distance. Though highly skilled in ESP, he lacks significant combat training, something that concerns both his instructors and his mission partner, [[First Lieutenant Blaine Richmond Carter]].

Samuel's background is one of hardship. He spent nearly 20 years in an underground facility as a test subject before being rescued by [[Writing/Antitheriomorphosis/Characters/Godzilla/Godzilla, the King of the Monsters]] alongside other ESP-sensitive individuals. Since then, he has been under Monarch's care and is now part of the first generation of ESP students at Castle Bravo. His mission alongside Blaine marks his first major assignment outside of a controlled training environment.

## Personality

Samuel is highly dedicated to his studies, often preferring to refine existing skills rather than develop new ones. He is deeply attached to his fellow ESP students, viewing them as family due to their shared traumatic past. Despite his talents, he struggles with self-confidence, particularly when separated from his peers.

He values routine and structure, often preparing for tests well in advance, and exhibits a quiet, introspective nature. However, he can be self-deprecating when under stress. While he deeply appreciates the new life given to him by Monarch, he still grapples with anxiety, particularly regarding solo missions.
