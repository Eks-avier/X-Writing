* Godzilla is technically a junior as well. A *T. gojira *is often identified as “Son of Father.” They're paternal. So, Godzilla's actual name within his species is Son of Dagon, and Dagon in turn would be identified as Son of Dagon's Father, and so on. Thus, Godzilla's true name would actually be something like *Dagonson *or* Dagon Junior. *
* It is only now when Godzilla could finally express himself post-Antitheriomorphosis that this was revealed. He would have been identified, internally, within their species as *Dagonson*, *Dagon Junior*, or the formal *Son of Dagon*.
* It's important to note that the Titan's current names are all given by humans! The Titans internally identify differently. Eventually, and especially during the times where Titans interacted with humans in prehistory, the Titans learned to simply accept the names humans have given them. Now, post-Antitheriomorphosis, they have a chance to choose names for themselves or express how they internally identify. Some have changed them, others have changed. For Godzilla though, he has accepted the names *Godzilla *and *Gojira*, identifying and answering to either. He has also approved the use of the name *gojira* as his species' taxon.
* The social order of *T. gojira* varies from faction to faction. They are** all** unfailingly patriarchal.
* All *T. gojira* are monogamous.
* The Northerners are led not by an Alpha but by all the *Northern Patriarchs *with at least a son or daughter already undergoing the betrothal trial and territory. No females and no males without mates, territory, or offspring—lacking at least one of those disqualifies them from a leadership position.
* The betrothal trial works as follows:
   * Only offspring that are equivalent to human 10-12 year olds may be eligible. Any less or more and the leadership will be involved.
   * A match will be done by both participants' parents.
   * A male will be matched with the female—neither may refuse.
   * Both participants' fathers will decide on which of them will loan the territory necessary for the trial. Often it is the male's.
   * If neither father has been able to reach a decision, another match will be done *effective immediately* **or***** ***the leadership gets involved.
   * Once the territory has begun, the male and female will be tasked to survive without any sort of *direct* supervision from their parents.
   * While other races have their own rituals, unique to the North is that the males will do everything laborious.
   * Male and female *must* learn to work together to survive.
   * Initially, it is the duty of both male and female to build their first shelter.
   * Once shelter has been developed, the male will often seek to expand it by searching for viable space. If obstacles whether in the shape of terrain or living organism is in the way, the male must do everything to secure the necessary resources.
   * The female must now establish the way 'home' appears, picking up on the male's expansion. As the male expands horizons, the females must ensure everything is stable, safe, and secure. She is in charge of defense should the male find himself far from the shelter.
   * Everything that has to do with gathering resources *outside *the established territory is the male's job.
   * Everything that has to do with gathering resources *within* the territory is the female's job.
   * On top of their primary duties, they must also find the time to bond and form a connection, a relationship.
   * This will continue until their the human-equivalent of 18 years old.
* Provided that the male and female form a strong enough bond with each other and are committed to do so indefinitely, then they will be "married".
* Once married, cannot be broken. No divorce, no annulment, **nothing**. 
* They will not just be **one whole** but their entire families will be whole as well.
   * Mothers and fathers on either side are simply called and treated as mother and father.
   * Any siblings are also their siblings
   * The siblings' mates are now their siblings.
   * They are now **one**, now and forever.
   * The territory that was loaned as well as the ones the male conquered beyond are his and his new mate's initial territory.
* Only after they are considered bonded forever will they be allowed to reproduce. 
   * They cannot reproduce during the trials, that is extremely taboo.
   * But any offspring are still accepted, their natural tendency to care for family transcends such things.
   * The limitation is for keeping order and ensuring that the male and female are **truly** ready for mating.
* Should the bond be unstable and cannot be resolved, the leadership will recommend a rematch with another family.
   * This is the **worst **case scenario. Not only is this incredibly costly for both families, it is also taxing for the participants.
   * It is of the **utmost** importance that the initial match succeeds.
   * Males are trained from birth in their ways by their fathers and females are trained by their mothers. A male's mother and daughter's father will of course provide the necessary instruction on interacting with the opposite sex.
      * This only compounds just how *costly* a mismatch is.
      * While daughters typically cannot refuse betrothal, for the sake of all parties involved, if it really doesn't work they **need **to say immediately. 
      * Sons have a duty to hear this complaint and take it to the female's family. The sooner this is addressed, the sooner a new match can be made.
* Choosing the patriarch to represent the family is pretty straightforward for other factions: the oldest and strongest is the patriarch. However, the North allows younger fathers to become one should he prove to be more adaptable.
* The chosen patriarch now represents his family's interests in the leadership.
* By Love for Friends, it means love for *other factions *of gojira. They could not give any less of a flying, swimming, breathing fuck about other Titan species. This actually puts them in a weird position. On par with the T. mosura for being one of the strongest species the Earth has ever housed, and yet they do not care about interacting with other Titan species. Perhaps it is their unique gifts that allow them to be untouched by the warring, violent, messy Titans surrounding them. It has also been noted that Titans in the territories of both species appear well-behaved.
* It's important to note that *T. gojira* are completely ethnocentric. This is why the Western Gojira are unique in prioritizing friendship among other regional factions and why Southerners are unique in having a lot of intermarriage among the lesser known factions. In spite of this, both still possess a supermajority of pure blood. 
* Reproduction between factions, while not prohibited, is discouraged. However, along regional boundaries, they are more common--though still vastly rare.
* Play his highly encouraged in the North. They have a popular game that is basically tug of war but with energy. Both players emit energy and either player must convert the opponent's energy faster than they do. 
* T. gojira are fewer than most Titan populations so they have the incentive not to fuck everything up—ESPECIALLY every process related to reproduction.
