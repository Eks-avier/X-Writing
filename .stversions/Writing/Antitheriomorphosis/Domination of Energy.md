# DOMINATION OF ENERGY: A TECHNICAL DISCUSSION

*Transcript from Castle Bravo Field Operation Debrief #374*  
*Post-Xillien Invasion Recovery Phase, Observation Bay 3*  
*Restricted Level: EYES ONLY - MONARCH-4*

---

The observation bay hummed with the quiet drone of machinery, holographic displays casting a blue glow across the steel tables. Henry hunched over a terminal, replaying footage frame by frame while Selena analyzed energy readings on a separate screen. The metallic taste of recycled air hung between them, punctuated by the occasional ping of incoming data.

Through the reinforced glass, they could see Godzilla in the distance, methodically tearing through the hull of a downed Xillien vessel. His movements were precise, calculated—nothing like the raw destructive force they'd come to expect from him.

Henry tapped his earpiece, leaning forward. "Can't he just, oh I dunno... blast a hole in that hull?"

Selena didn't look up from her readings, her face bathed in the blue light of her display. "That depends on several factors, one of which is: is he interested in doing it?"

"I mean, it's much easier than prying it open; the package won't be harmed anyway." Henry gestured toward the screen where energy readings fluctuated in complex patterns.

"You're overestimating our tech," Selena replied, eyes narrowing at a particular spike in the data.

A new voice cut through their comms, rich with barely concealed amusement. "Are you aware he can probably hear you from there? Your comms are open."

Selena's head snapped up, her expression shifting from concentration to irritation. "Oh you don't say—?"

Before she could finish, a blinding flash of blue light erupted from the observation window. When their vision cleared, a perfectly circular hole had been punched through the Xillien hull, edges still glowing with residual energy.

"Holy crap..." Henry whispered, frantically adjusting settings on his recording equipment. "Tell me you captured everything!"

"Always," Selena breathed, her irritation momentarily forgotten. "Remember, always!"

She zoomed in on the damage, her professional demeanor cracking with genuine awe. "He shredded that thing... without even touching it?"

Henry stared at the readings flooding his screen, shaking his head in disbelief. "Who the hell is this guy?! Is he even Godzilla?"

Selena spun her chair toward the doorway where Battra had materialized, his human form draped in elegant purple robes, his crimson eyes fixed on the scene outside. "Just what in the hell happened during your fight, magic man?"

The comm system crackled again. Godzilla's deep voice resonated through the speakers, devoid of emotion. "I have retrieved the package."

Henry quickly switched channels. "Right on, Your Majesty! Could you please drop it off at this location? Everything's ready there, all you gotta do is drop it."

As Godzilla moved away from the wreckage, Selena turned her full attention to Battra, who seemed to be deliberately avoiding eye contact.

"You didn't answer my question, magic man."

Battra examined his perfectly manicured nails with exaggerated interest. "I don't see the need to do so."

"Well... you're right..." Selena began to turn back to her console.

Battra's eyebrow twitched, his expression souring. "Augh, fine. Your curiosity is getting too noisy."

"What does that even—"

"What do you think can the King do?" Battra interrupted, crossing his arms. "Do you have a list of his abilities?"

Henry appeared behind them, seemingly materializing from nowhere, a tablet clutched in his hands. "Well, we tend to take note of them as they come... Helps with knowing what's going on, usually. But I'm not about to make the tedious decision of calling Mark for that."

He scrolled through his tablet, the light reflecting off his glasses. "Besides, it's just heightened regeneration, passive absorption and dispersion of radiation, violent dispersal of radiation, which he can do with his whole body or his mouth, and... that's about it." He looked up with a shrug. "He's a living walking nuke that makes huge explosions and is impossible to kill. Of all the Titan abilities, his is one of the most straightforward."

Henry tapped the screen, bringing up an older file. "Helps that he's one of the earliest to be discovered, analyzed, and catalogued too."

Selena jumped slightly, turning toward him. "How long have you been standing there?"

"I'm surprised you didn't notice him, little one..." Battra remarked, a smirk playing at the corners of his mouth. "But I see. You've taken note of his passive absorption and dispersion. Most would simply note his..."

"Atomic breath!" Henry interjected, his enthusiasm cutting through the tension.

Battra's eyebrows rose slightly. "Is that what you call it?"

"Is it called anything else?" Selena asked, unable to keep the skepticism from her voice.

"Naturally, human." Battra's voice took on a didactic tone. "Though translations may be odd among Titans, some species have called it the Cannon of Starlight, Fire of Destruction, Fire of Death, Eternal Death, Everlasting Flames, and so on..."

Henry's eyes widened with excitement. "We should start calling it that too!"

"Yeah right..." Selena rolled her eyes. "They sound too edgy. Why'd you ask for any of this anyway?"

"You're so lame..." Henry muttered.

Battra's expression grew more serious, his crimson eyes reflecting the blue light of the monitors. "Because his abilities are simultaneously straightforward and complicated."

"You're lamer, dork," Selena fired back at Henry before turning to Battra. "If you're gonna yap about the minute details of the atomic radiation he uses, it's on his file."

"Talking 'bout yappin', why don't you shut it instead?" Henry shot back. "Literal sorcerer supreme of our planet is talking here. Don't you want some valuable insight?"

Battra tilted his head. "Sorcerer supreme?"

"It's just a comic thing, go on Battra," Henry urged, shooting Selena a triumphant look.

Battra leaned closer, his voice dropping to an almost conspiratorial whisper. "Little ones, I theorize that the King of all Titans Godzilla possesses the ability to dominate energy."

Henry's excitement visibly deflated. "That's it...?"

"So much for insight..." Selena muttered.

"Shut it!" Henry snapped.

He turned back to Battra, struggling to hide his disappointment. "What do you mean by that, then?"

Selena crossed her arms. "Dominating energy? You mean manipulating energy. Also, energy? Isn't it atomic energy?"

Battra straightened, his robes shimmering slightly in the dim light. "The point I want to express, little ones... is that Godzilla isn't simply limited to atomic energy, which is your word for the energy one gains from splitting or combining atoms—the Tiny Builders."

"That's a cute name. Is that what you call an atom?" Henry asked, his interest rekindled.

"Indeed. They are quite cooperative when you're doing magic well. They *build* for you if your mastery is adequate enough."

Henry leaned forward. "Although... I assume sorcery interacts with it differently?"

"The only difference between our methods, human, is that mine is as precise as the word precision can get."

"Jealous..." Henry mumbled.

"Now, to elaborate further." Battra began pacing, his movements fluid and graceful. "Have you ever wondered why the other Titans seem to never use their abilities when the King is around?"

Selena's skepticism remained evident, but curiosity crept into her voice. "I assume it's fear, isn't it?"

"Correct, but also not quite." Battra stopped, turning to face them fully. "It is indeed out of fear and respect that they do not use it, but did you notice that not even the ambient expression of their abilities are active in his presence?"

"Keep going..." Selena urged, despite herself.

"The powers of the Titans is, what you may call for all intents and purposes: magic." Battra's hands moved as he spoke, occasional sparks of purple energy dancing between his fingers. "It's more pronounced now that they're humans; this magic is powered by energy, energy that you cannot perceive, but it is there nonetheless—Primus."

Henry's eyes widened. "You know what, I've always wondered, will we be able to perceive it? Like, in the future, with tech and stuff. Maybe my kids will be sorcerers some day."

"Never," Battra stated flatly, causing Henry's face to fall. "For you to be able to interact with it, you must be able to perceive it. Unfortunately, your soul forbids such a thing. As a consequence, no technology you build today or tomorrow will enable you to perceive the energy of magic."

Selena threw up her hands. "What the fuck does any of that even mean?"

"Um..." Battra hesitated, seeming momentarily thrown off by her directness.

"Alright, never mind!" He waved a hand dismissively. "In any case, all you need to know of magic in this context is that it is a form of energy. It can come in many forms, but ultimately it has... a base form—Primus."

His expression grew more serious. "Now, Godzilla is incapable of perceiving this energy—Primus. He is as limited as you are in terms of perceiving magic."

"Wait, what?!" Henry exclaimed.

Selena's brow furrowed. "If he is blind to it like humans are, shouldn't he be weak to it?"

"But you lost to him," Henry added, "and the rest of the Titans who you said express their abilities in this... magical energy... are subservient to him..."

"That's precisely the point." Battra's voice carried a hint of lingering frustration. "He should be absolutely weak to it... And yet, he isn't. Because the energy he wields negates it."

"So you're saying atomic energy nullifies magic?" Selena asked, her skepticism giving way to genuine curiosity.

"No, not atomic energy. In fact, that form of energy is *subservient* to the will of magic, making it doubly confusing for me."

Selena ran a hand through her hair. "That's... ridiculous! Utter bullshit, and yet... How can I even... Oh, whatever just go on."

Battra's voice dropped to a murmur, almost as if he were talking to himself. "To think he had the intuition to know that he would be the better foe for me rather than my sister... Could he have possibly known of his abilities?"

"Yeah..." Henry interjected. "He was really adamant to be faced against you. Both of him and your sister had a HUGE argument over it. I didn't understand why Mothra said Godzilla isn't equipped to deal with you... So *should* he be weak to magic?"

Battra's head snapped up. "What? And what did he say back?"

"He'll win," Selena stated simply.

"Typical Godzilla..." Battra muttered, a complex emotion crossing his features.

"For some reason that shut Mothra up too," Selena added.

"And well, he did win after all..." Henry pointed out.

Battra's eyes widened with sudden realization. "He knew. I am most certain of it. He knew definitely!"

"Do you have a name for what energy he wields?" Henry asked, tapping notes into his tablet. "Well, besides atomic energy... Not just that..."

"We wanted to find out HOW he does it. But..." His voice trailed off.

"But...?" Battra prompted.

"But it's odd. We were tracing elements and figuring out which one he used to power himself. Uranium and all that stuff. You get it?"

Selena nodded, pulling up a complex molecular structure on her display. "Yup... It was Uranium, but then it wasn't. And then it was again. And then it was a different element again. Unknown ones too. Thanks to him Monarch has made several world-changing discoveries in a single day, but... in the end, we weren't any closer to discovering his source of energy nor his process."

"His energy, it just changes... constantly..." Henry gestured helplessly at the shifting data.

Battra's expression grew solemn. "And that is precisely who he is. He is nature's most perfect soldier; an agent of change; evolution itself. Godzilla's true power is not even the domination of energy as I have just told you. His true power is ever-constant evolution, or rather, adaptation, whichever word you feel is most apt to use."

"That's how you lost to him?" Selena asked, eyes wide.

"Not even a doppelganger of himself with the ability to adapt to any and all phenomena could succeed..." Battra's voice carried a hint of lingering disbelief. "A 3v1 and he made it feel like my advantage was nothing."

"A what?!?! Your fight was a 3v1?!" Selena exclaimed.

"You gotta stop that, seriously," Henry muttered.

"How... How are you taking this so easily? This is literally GIBBERISH." Selena's voice rose with increasing frustration. "Ever-constant evolution? Domination of energy? Magic energy? Doppelgangers? What the FUCK, next you'll tell me that Godzilla can... Hold on... Holy fuck..."

Her eyes suddenly widened with realization, her gaze darting back to her data screens.

"I suppose you really are excellently picked by the King, hm?" Battra remarked, something like respect flickering across his features.

"Shut up, magician," Selena snapped, her fingers flying across her keyboard. "Anyway... His energy constantly fluctuates from one element to another... It wasn't our instruments that were at fault... Mark was wrong."

She spun to face them, excitement overtaking her previous skepticism. "First of all, everything was functioning correctly, Mark can stop pouring budget in those repairs. Second of all, you're implying that he can dominate ANY form of energy, even this... base magical energy you're talking about. Am I right?"

"Incorrect, Miss Selena—he cannot perceive Primus, and thus cannot use magic," Battra corrected. "Impressive that you identified the limitless implication of his ability, though. It seems Monarch chose you well for your job."

"Where would you put the budget instead?" Henry interjected. "You're not seriously going to tell him to put a salon there, are you?"

"Oh spare me, Battra. And fuck off, Henry," Selena shot back. "If we can have a magical and psychic school in our damn *headquarters*, we can stand to put some salons there too. I need my nails done often, you know."

"You're actually insane. I've never met a girl who acts like you; then again, thin line between genius and batshit crazy and all that, right?" Henry turned back to Battra. "Anyway, what does that have to do with his constant adaptation, then? You mean to say he can adapt his energy to his foes? Then why didn't he do it against Ghidorah?"

"As if you meet any girls at all," Selena muttered under her breath.

"Ugh, humans..." Battra sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.

After a moment, he continued. "To that question: I theorize that he wasn't even aware that it was possible at that time. Furthermore, it's also unlikely he would suddenly change his fighting style out of the blue. For all that he is as the herald of evolution, he's incredibly rigid in thinking. How that works, I can never understand... A creature so set in his ways, yet possess the innate ability to adapt and evolve at a moment's notice... What an enigma."

"Ugh, an old man," Selena muttered.

"An old man that can wipe a city off the Earth," Henry pointed out. "But I mean, it's Ghidorah. He likely was just super pissed at him to think all that straight."

"Good point. He smiled in my fight," Battra said almost casually.

"HE WHAT?" Selena's head snapped up.

"You must've been so easy, man. What the fuck..." She added with a disbelieving laugh.

Battra scoffed, his pride clearly wounded. "That's after I sliced him clean in half, and prior to that blowing a hole in his chest. Damn monster."

"He was **bisected**? And **donuted**?!" Henry gaped.

"Donuted...?" Battra's brow furrowed in confusion.

"Shut up about your anime!" Selena snapped.

She turned back to Battra, her analytical mind still processing. "Shouldn't it be manipulation of energy?"

"Manipulation sounds far too soft," Battra replied, his tone shifting to something more precise, more academic. "As if he's just *convincing* the energy before him to make it available for use—like Magic, like how the soul converts Primus."

His eyes flashed momentarily. "No, Godzilla's domination of energy is exactly as what it entails."

"Crazy..." Henry whispered. "Energy just bends to his will like that..."

"Did you know he can even convert *other* matter into energy he can use?" Battra added.

"NO WAY, did he really?" Henry's excitement was palpable.

"So the other Titans have their energies nulled, then?" Selena asked, focusing on the practical implications.

"Yes." Battra's expression darkened. "Frankly, I thought I'd be immune to any suppression of magic, as I have countless spells and contingencies to counter such an event should it occur, but... I didn't expect someone incapable of perceiving it to do so."

He began pacing again, the memory clearly still fresh. "My multitasking skills were tested to the very extreme in that fight. I had two of the most powerful puppets I have ever made out in the open, while actually controlling and directing them, while thinking of all the ways to outmaneuver him, while minding my energy costs, all while shuffling my sorcery sources 100 times just to prevent it from being nullified, because if I didn't do that: neither I or my puppets could do any damage to him."

His voice dropped. "That is how strong the nullification is."

"Shit..." Henry breathed.

"Holy fuck..." Selena whispered.

"Indeed. It was... exhausting." For the first time, genuine fatigue showed in Battra's expression. "He was the one supposed to be pressured, yet I felt like I needed 200 times the effort to match him."

Battra's gaze drifted to the window, where Godzilla could still be seen in the distance. "He was right, I should've just neutralized him immediately... I was too over my head to think I could outmatch the King of the Titans in a contest of attrition, pure power, and... skill."

"Sounds like you were just... outmatched from the start," Selena observed.

Battra let out a surprisingly genuine laugh. "You may be right. A single one of his new atomic beams—"

"It's called Atomic Railgun," Henry cut in.

"—as you called it," Battra continued smoothly, "tore apart my arms and prevented me from using any spells."

"That thin laser he now shoots out of his fingers?" Selena asked, her eyes widening slightly. "He used that on you?"

Outside, Godzilla turned toward the observation bay, his blue eyes meeting theirs across the distance. All three fell silent as his gaze lingered for a moment, before he turned away, continuing his methodical examination of the alien wreckage.
