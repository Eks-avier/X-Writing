# Phase One: Announcement

The late afternoon sun cast long shadows through Castle Bravo's reinforced windows, creating odd patterns across Samuel Johns' calculus notes. He was one of the few students still focused on studying—or at least attempting to—while most of his classmates had succumbed to the listless atmosphere that often preceded dinner time.

“I still can't believe you're studying for a quiz that's after winter break,” Kane remarked from two seats behind, his voice carrying the distinctive sound of someone unwrapping candy. “You know that's like, weeks away, right?”

Sam didn't look up from his notes. “Better than ending up like last time when Andrew from the sorcery division scored higher than all of us combined.”

“That was one time,” Julia chimed in from her spot near the window, where she was using her telekinesis to arrange paper snowflakes on the glass. “And he probably used some weird magic to enhance his brain or something.”

“That's not how sorcery works,” Nathan corrected her, though his attention was mostly focused on the handheld game console floating in front of him—courtesy of Suki's telekinesis. “We've been over this like a hundred times.”

Julia shrugged, adding another snowflake to her growing display. “Well, whatever. I still think—”

The rest of her sentence was cut short as their teacher phased through the wall, his black and purple robes billowing despite the lack of wind. The students barely reacted—Battra's dramatic entrances had long since become part of their daily routine. This one was actually quite tame compared to last week's appearance, which had involved a shower of sparklers and what looked suspiciously like a mariachi band.

“Good afternoon, my delightfully ordinary students,” Battra greeted them, hovering a few inches off the ground. Several colorful hologram-like objects circled around him, resembling cute file folders.

“It's never good when he calls us ordinary,” Gerome muttered from his seat near the front, though there was a hint of fondness in his voice. As the eldest student at 21, he often acted as the unofficial voice of reason for their class.

Battra's crimson eyes gleamed. “Now, now, Mr. Marcel. Is that any way to greet your beloved teacher who brings such exciting news?”

“Last time you said you had exciting news, we ended up having to chase a possessed vending machine through three levels of Castle Bravo,” Suki pointed out, finally releasing her telekinetic hold on Nathan's gaming console. “The cafeteria staff still gives us dirty looks.”

“Ah, but that was a valuable lesson in practical applications of telepathic interference with mechanical systems!” Battra defended, performing a small aerial spin. “Besides, this is actually important news. Monarch has located a titan breeding facility.”

The classroom's atmosphere shifted immediately. Sam finally looked up from his notes, his full attention captured. Even Kane stopped rustling his candy wrapper.

“Where?” Gerome asked, straightening in his seat.

“Somewhere in the American countryside,” Battra replied, his usual playful tone taking on a more serious edge. “Monarch's been working with local authorities to track it down. They've gathered quite a bit of evidence about the facility's operations.”

“Wouldn't Godzilla usually handle something like this?” Julia asked, her snowflakes forgotten. “I mean, before the whole Antitheriomorphosis thing?”

“Ah, yes.” Battra nodded, settling into what the students recognized as his 'lecture mode' pose. “A decade ago, our atomic friend would have simply reduced the place to radioactive rubble. But adjusting to a human form takes time—even for the King of Monsters.”

“Not to mention the paperwork involved in property damage now,” Kane added with a grin.

“Indeed, Mr. Thompson. The King had to learn that humans generally frown upon solving problems with atomic breath.” Battra's eyes crinkled with amusement. “Though I must say, watching him discover the concept of filing insurance claims was quite entertaining.”

Sam found himself smiling despite the serious subject matter. The image of Godzilla, even in human form, dealing with bureaucracy was admittedly funny. His amusement was short-lived, however, as Battra's expression shifted to something more purposeful.

“But we're not here to discuss our absent King's adventures in human paperwork,” Battra declared, gesturing dramatically. The cute file folders circling him began to glow more brightly. “We have work to do.”

“Three missions, to be precise.” He waved his hand, and three hologram-like visuals materialized in the air. Each one was adorned with chibi-style decorations that seemed at odds with their serious purpose. “And I've devised a rather interesting distribution of personnel.”

Suki leaned forward in her seat. “How are we splitting up?”

“Excellent question, Ms. Takao!” Battra's enthusiasm made several students exchange worried glances. Their teacher's excitement usually meant someone was in for an interesting time. “We'll be working with a 5-4-1 split.”

The classroom erupted in immediate discussion. Sam watched as the cute hologram displayed three groups waiting to be matched with their missions, his stomach already starting to knot with anxiety.

“One person alone?” Gerome's voice cut through the chatter. “That's too risky.”

“I volunteer,” Suki announced, standing up. Her chair scraped against the floor with a sound that made Sam wince. “I'm the strongest telepath and telekinetic in class. It makes the most sense—”

“Pure power isn't everything, Suki,” Gerome interrupted, his tone diplomatic but firm. “I have more combat experience. I should—”

“Which is exactly why you're needed to lead a team,” Suki countered. “My abilities make me the best choice for a solo mission.”

As his classmates continued to debate, Sam sank lower in his seat, silently praying he wouldn't be chosen for any particularly challenging role. He was comfortable with his abilities, but he preferred supporting others rather than taking the lead. Besides, his telepathic abilities worked best in tandem with his classmates, people he'd known and trusted for years.

“While I appreciate everyone's enthusiasm,” Battra's voice cut through the discussion like a knife through butter, “the assignments have already been determined.” The mystical visual beside him mimicked his gesture as he raised his hand for silence.

Sam watched in growing horror as Battra enlarged the visual. Each student's name transformed into an adorable chibi version of themselves, and as the assignments were revealed, he felt his world tilt sideways.

The first mission went to Suki and her team: a bust operation in Mexico targeting some kind of titan-based contraband. The second, a retrieval operation in rural England involving a potentially captive titan, was assigned to Gerome's team.

And the solo mission…

Sam's horror mounted as he watched his chibi-self skip cheerfully toward the third assignment, completely oblivious to his real self's mounting dread.

“This isn't right,” Nathan was the first to speak up. “Sam works best with a team. Let me take his place—”

“I'll go instead,” Julia offered immediately.

“Or we could redistribute—” Gerome began, but Battra was already moving.

With a flourish, their teacher minimized the visual. The projection spiraled into a thin string of light that phased through the walls, presumably heading toward Castle Bravo's central command. Before anyone could protest further, Battra vanished, leaving behind only a floating note.

Suki caught it with her telekinesis before anyone could grab it. Her eyes scanned the paper before she broadcast its contents telepathically to everyone: they would depart tomorrow evening, and Sam would meet his partner at dawn.

A partner. Singular. As in one person.

“Sam?” Kane's voice was uncharacteristically gentle. “You okay there, buddy?”

Sam realized he'd been staring blankly at his calculus notes for the past minute. The equations now looked like meaningless scribbles. “Yeah,” he managed, though his voice sounded distant even to himself. “I'm fine.”

Nobody believed him, of course. As they filed out through the Wall Walk toward their living quarters, Sam felt the weight of his classmates' concern pressing against his mind like a warm blanket. They were trying to be supportive while respecting his mental space, but their worry leaked through anyway.

The ocean breeze carried the salt-tinged air across Castle Bravo, and Sam couldn't help but notice how the facility's lights were starting to come on as evening approached. Somewhere in the distance, a seabird called out across the waters.

“Hey,” Suki fell into step beside him, her voice low. “Whatever this mission is, you'll handle it. You're stronger than you think.”

Sam managed a weak smile. “Thanks, Suki.”

But as they walked, he couldn't shake the feeling that this mission would change everything. He just hoped it wouldn't be as traumatic as their escape had been. One life-altering experience was enough for anyone.

Behind them, the Christmas tree in their classroom twinkled merrily through the window, its lights reflecting off the paper snowflakes Julia had arranged. The festive scene seemed to belong to a different world entirely—one where ESP students weren't sent on solo missions with mysterious partners.

“At least it can't be worse than the possessed vending machine incident,” Kane offered, trying to lighten the mood.

Sam wasn't so sure about that.

# Phase One: Reflections

The student quarters of Castle Bravo were deliberately designed to feel different from the rest of the facility. While the science and military sections maintained a utilitarian aesthetic of muted grays and steel blues, the residential wing was awash with warmer colors and softer lighting. Sam had once overheard Dr. Chen—he could never tell which twin—say it was important for the students to have a space that felt like home rather than an institution.

Now, sitting on the edge of his bed, Sam wondered if that well-intentioned design choice made everything feel more surreal. The late afternoon sun filtered through his window, mixing with the salty ocean breeze to create an almost meditative atmosphere in his room. His wavy auburn hair brushed against his eyes as he stared out at the horizon, where the sea met the sky in an endless blue expanse.

“I should probably get a haircut,” he muttered to himself, absently brushing the strands away from his face. He liked his current look, but it was starting to become a distraction. The last thing he needed was hair in his eyes during whatever this mission turned out to be.

His open duffel bag sat accusingly empty on the floor. What exactly did one pack for a mysterious solo mission? With his classmates—his family—he could afford to be casual about preparation. They covered for each other's oversights, shared supplies, and generally treated missions like elaborate field trips. But now…

“Will it even be long enough to need a change of clothes?” he wondered aloud, pulling his knees up to his chest. “Should I pack something for my partner? What if they forget something important?” He paused, then added with a touch of self-deprecation, “What if I forget something important?”

The view outside his window offered no answers. It was one of the best perks of living in Castle Bravo—the endless panorama of sea and sky. Sam would have kept his window open all the time if it weren't for the various sea birds and critters that seemed to view his room as prime real estate.

His mind drifted to the past fortnight, which now felt like a different lifetime. He'd spent it in an almost peaceful routine: sleeping, studying, meditating, and hanging out with his classmates and scientist friends in the hangar. The highlight had been when renowned psychic Miki Saegusa visited the base.

A small smile tugged at his lips as he remembered how excited they'd all been. Miss Saegusa was only three years older than Gerome, but her accomplishments were legendary. The first psychic—and still the only human—to have successfully linked minds with Godzilla himself. Like them, she knew what it was like to be treated as a tool rather than a person. And like them, she'd found salvation through an unlikely source: the King of Monsters.

“The sorcery students thought we'd lost our minds,” Sam chuckled, remembering the chaos that had erupted during her visit. The rivalry between the ESP and sorcery divisions wasn't hostile—Battra would never allow that—but it was definitely spirited. Especially between Suki and Andrew Ford, the top sorcery student. Everyone kept trying to pair them up, which only seemed to irritate them both more.

Sam flopped back onto his bed, bouncing slightly as he stared at the ceiling. Everyone at Monarch treated them well—even the titans. Godzilla had been the one to save them, collapsing their underground prison to expose its location to Monarch. Sam could still remember those piercing golden eyes, filled with… something. Even now, no one quite knew what the King of Monsters truly thought or felt. Maybe Miss Saegusa did, or perhaps Mothra, but Sam doubted even they fully understood him.

Mothra had been their healing angel, becoming the mother figure none of them had ever known. She still visited regularly, encouraging both divisions to share their problems and offering help wherever needed. The running joke was that she made the best steak anyone had ever tasted, but whenever someone asked for her secret, she just giggled and changed the subject.

And Battra… Sam smiled despite his anxiety. Their teacher was equal parts mentor and chaos agent, but they all knew he loved them, and they loved him right back. He remembered both divisions helping Battra prank his twin sister without hesitation or questions. For all his eccentricities, Battra had shown them what they were capable of becoming.

The other titans maintained varying degrees of distance, which Mothra assured them was nothing personal. “Not all titans are comfortable with human presence,” she'd explained. “But that doesn't mean they dislike you.”

Sam sighed heavily, slumping further into his mattress. Monarch had given them everything they'd never dared dream of: their own rooms, personal gadgets, freedom to move around, and most importantly, a real home. It was everything a scared boy hooked up to machines in a dark facility had wished for.

“So why am I so terrified?” he asked his empty room. “Why does this feel so…” He gestured vaguely at the air, unable to find the right word.

Battra's lessons about mental fortitude surfaced in his mind, probably his subconscious trying to shake him out of his spiral. Sam sighed again and forced himself to sit up. He needed to at least attempt to pack something.

Before he could reach for the duffel bag, a knock echoed through his room.

“Come in,” he called out, expecting maybe one or two of his classmates.

Instead, all nine of them poured in like a tidal wave of support and concern. They surrounded him, offering advice, reassurance, and most importantly, their unwavering presence.

Sam felt something warm kindle in his chest, spreading through his limbs and pushing back the cold anxiety that had been gripping him. What had he been thinking? He had his family. He could do this—would do this—for them.

Looking at their encouraging faces, Sam finally felt something close to ready. Whatever this mission threw at him, he wouldn't be facing it alone. Not really.

He just hoped his mystery partner was ready for what they were getting into.

# Phase One: Midnight Stroll

Sleep eluded Sam. Despite having only four to six hours left before dawn, anxiety gnawed at his stomach, an unwelcome companion keeping him frustratingly awake. He'd tried everything—different sleeping positions, breathing exercises, counting sheep—but nothing worked. Even meditation, usually his refuge, proved futile. His mind was too scattered, too preoccupied.

Against his better judgment, Sam got up. Glancing at the windows beside his bed, he could see how the facility's lights cut through what would otherwise be an endless black abyss of ocean. He didn't care.

Wearing nothing but his night clothes, he made a silent beeline for the hangar. The decision proved immediately regrettable as the night breeze hit him like a freezing gale. He should have at least grabbed a jacket or coat. But now, shivering on the hangar deck, Sam figured maybe he needed this discomfort.

The hangar was well-lit, a stark contrast to the darkness below. Usually, there would still be activity—Castle Bravo never truly slept—but tonight the hangar seemed deserted. Sam's psychic senses detected others still awake throughout the facility: some on night shifts, others in their quarters or labs, burning the midnight oil. But none were in the hangar. He was safe from prying eyes.

All of Battra's students, whether from the sorcery or ESP division, had been thoroughly schooled in the art of expert pranking—likely part of their teacher's endless campaign against Mothra. As a result, Sam knew the location of every surveillance camera in Castle Bravo by heart. While they could convince people they didn't exist in their minds, fooling machines proved more challenging.

Sam gracefully navigated around the cameras with practiced ease, making his way to an empty space devoid of aircraft or equipment. This was one of the designated hangout spots in the hangar, hence its nickname: the Hanger-Out. Nobody knew who'd coined that terrible pun, but somehow it had stuck.

Not long ago, it had been made official as an alternative gathering place to the cafeteria. Chairs appeared, along with regular deliveries of snacks and drinks from the kitchen. People could enjoy the ocean breeze and the view while taking their breaks.

Finding a monoblock chair, Sam sat down and let the cool midnight air wash over him. He stared into the abyss below. Most people his age would be unnerved by such absolute darkness, but Sam had spent nearly two decades of his life in an underground facility. His classmates—his family—were the only people he'd known. As melodramatic as it sounded, he was born in darkness. For now, he found peace in it, finally slipping into a meditative state.

Sam lost track of time, but eventually decided he'd had enough. The knot in his stomach had loosened, and he'd rather not risk hypothermia. Maneuvering through the orderly scattered equipment, he made his way toward the entryway to the student residences.

Then he sensed a presence. He halted just before the entryway. Though his eyes couldn't make anything out, his mind painted a different picture.

Battra forbade them from reading thoughts without consent, citing his twin sister who considered it rude and unethical. However, surface thoughts were fair game—no different from reading body language. Sam's reach stopped just short of the stranger. A man.

Psychic projection was an advanced skill, but Johns was one of six who could do it, and one of three who could manage it from a distance. Only Gerome could fully project across great distances, which made him exceptional at covert missions. Still, Sam's abilities weren't shabby, and he spotted the man leaning against the hangar's railings.

The hangar lights reached far enough for Sam to make out some details. The man had ash-blonde hair cut short. He was broad-shouldered and tall, wearing nothing but a white shirt and pants. His head was partially obscured by shadow, hiding some features, but Sam could see the shadow of stubble on his jaw, which moved animatedly as he spoke into a phone.

Sam had to admit, objectively speaking, that the man was attractive. Perhaps the girls would be better judges, but it seemed like a simple fact.

Suddenly, the man paused and looked around. Finding nothing, he resumed his phone conversation. But Sam had already fled, sneaking as gracefully as he could back to his room.

Checking his phone once safely inside, Sam cursed. It was 2 AM.

He flopped onto his bed, bouncing slightly, and found his eyes finally growing heavy. Within minutes, Sam was out cold, unaware of how this chance encounter would soon complicate his life even further.
