# The Classroom

"For the last time, no turning the snowmen into mind-controlled soldiers," Battra announced as he phased through the wall of the ESP homeroom. None of his students even flinched - they were far too used to their teacher's dramatic entrances by now.

"That was one time," Julia protested from her seat near the window. "And they were tiny snowmen!"

"They tried to stage a coup against the gingerbread house," Kane pointed out without looking up from his phone. "The sorcery students are still mad about that."

"The gingerbread house had it coming," Julia muttered, but her lips twitched into a smile.

The winter-themed classroom looked like it had been decorated by enthusiastic elementary schoolers rather than the group of 18-to-21-year-olds who actually did it. Snowmen lined the shelves while twinkling lights illuminated the corners. The bulletin board was festooned with white paper, green trees, and enough colorful garlands to make a Christmas store jealous. In the corner stood a 6-foot Christmas tree that looked like it had been attacked by a mob of sugar-high kids - covered in cards, baubles, action figures, and actual candy.

"Sir, is the candy on the tree off-limits?" Nathan asked hopefully. "Because I swear some of it keeps moving positions-"

"That's because Suki keeps stealing it," Gerome said dryly.

"I do not!" Suki protested, then paused. "Okay, maybe some of it. But I always replace what I take!"

"With sugar-free candy," another student grumbled. "It's not the same."

Battra floated cross-legged above his desk, his black and purple robes rippling despite the lack of wind. He couldn't help but smile at their bickering. For all their psychic powers, his students were still just young people who'd spent most of their lives in a cold, dark underground facility. Of course they'd go overboard with making their classroom feel like an actual school - right down to the petty candy theft.

"If we're done discussing confectionery crimes," Battra interrupted, though his crimson eyes sparkled with amusement, "I have actual business to discuss."

The bored looks returned to his students' faces. They should have been out shopping or whatever it was young people did these days. Instead, they were stuck here on a Sunday morning for what they probably assumed was just announcements.

*If only*, Battra mused. *They'd probably try to stage a coup if I called them in just for announcements. Probably with Julia's snowmen leading the charge.*

"I have three live missions for you," he announced. Ten pairs of eyes suddenly locked onto him with laser focus. "Nothing too difficult - just some covert ops and retrieval work."

"Finally!" Kane stuffed his phone away. "I was starting to think we'd never get out of here."

"Careful what you wish for," Sam murmured, not looking up from his calculus notes. "Last time someone said that, we ended up chasing a possessed vending machine across three states."

"That was fun though," Julia grinned. "Especially when it started shooting soda cans at those bank robbers."

"How are we splitting up?" Suki Takama asked, already sitting up straighter. The strongest telepath in the class never could resist a challenge.

With a theatrical gesture, Battra conjured a cutesy holographic display showing three mission groups waiting to be filled. "Five, four, and one."

A moment of silence, then-

"One?" Gerome Marcel's alarm cut through the room. "Someone's going solo?"

"I volunteer," he continued, squaring his broad shoulders. "I have the most combat experience-"

"Like hell you do," Suki interrupted, standing up. "I'm the strongest telepath here. I should-"

"Your solution to everything is 'throw things with your mind,'" Gerome argued.

"Because it works!"

"Remember the vending machine?"

"That was different-"

"Or we could *not* send anyone alone," Nathan suggested reasonably, though his voice was drowned out by the debate.

"I could do it," Kane offered, finally looking interested. "Multi-tasking is kind of my thing-"

"You can't even focus on one task right now," Julia pointed out, gesturing at his badly-hidden phone.

Battra silenced them all with a wave of his hand, the hologram mimicking his gesture. "The assignments are already set." He paused for effect as his students groaned. "And the solo operative will be accompanied by military personnel."

The groans turned to worried murmurs. They all knew what that meant - having to maintain mental links with non-telepaths was twice as challenging as working with their own kind. Battra had been drilling them on it for months, but they still struggled.

"Now then," Battra enlarged the hologram, chibi versions of his students appearing and beginning to float toward their assigned missions. "Team One, led by Suki - you're busting an illegal operation in Mexico. They're smuggling some... processed titan waste products."

"Gross," Julia gagged. "Please tell me it's not what I think it is."

"It's exactly what you think it is," Battra confirmed cheerfully as the first team's chibis waddled into position.

"Of course I get the poop mission," Suki muttered.

"Think of it as a chance to throw things with your mind," Gerome teased, earning himself a telekinetic flick to the ear.

"Team Two, under Gerome," Battra continued. "Retrieval op in rural England. We've detected a captured titan. Team of five since we don't know if it's hostile."

More chibis toddled across the hologram. The remaining students were starting to realize who hadn't been assigned yet.

Samuel Johns was still focused on his calculus notes when his classmate Kane elbowed him and pointed at the display. Sam's brown eyes went wide as saucers as he watched his chibi-self skip merrily toward the solo mission slot.

"No way," Sam whispered, whipping around to look at his classmates. They stared back with mixed sympathy and relief.

"I'll trade-" Nathan started.

"I can handle it instead-" Julia offered simultaneously.

"The rookie shouldn't go alone-" Kane protested.

"Sam's not a rookie," Suki defended. "He's better at mind-linking than most of us-"

"Assignments are final," Battra cut through the chorus of voices, dissolving the hologram into a string of light that zipped through the wall. He vanished with a pop, leaving only a note floating where he'd been.

Suki snagged it with her telekinesis before anyone else could grab it. Her voice echoed in all their heads: *Departure tomorrow evening. Sam meets his partner at dawn.*

The students deflated, gathering their things to head back to their quarters. As they walked through the mystical Wall Walk connecting Keep Charlie to the main facility, they surrounded Sam with reassurances and offers of help preparing.

"I'll help you pack," Julia offered. "I'm great at packing."

"You forgot your toothbrush on the last three missions," Kane reminded her.

"That's why I now have four toothbrushes," she said proudly.

"I can brief you on working with military types," Gerome offered more practically. "They're not as scary as they seem."

Sam barely heard them. His mind was stuck on one thought: *This is going to be worse than the day we escaped.*

He had no idea how right he was - but for entirely different reasons than he expected.

# The Midnight Watch

Sam's room in Castle Bravo was a far cry from the sterile underground facility he'd grown up in. The late afternoon sun painted his quarters in warm oranges and golds, mingling with the salty ocean breeze that drifted through his window. He would have kept it open all the time if it weren't for the birds that seemed to think his desk was prime real estate.

"What do you even pack for a mission like this?" he muttered, staring at his empty duffel bag. A collection of trinkets lined his shelves - small gifts from his classmates, a crystalline flower Mothra had given him (enchanted to never wilt), and his prized possession: a scale from Godzilla's human form, mounted in a simple frame. The King had given one to each of them after the rescue, though Sam still wasn't sure if it was meant as a promise of protection or a warning.

He flopped back onto his bed, auburn hair falling into his eyes. "Maybe I should cut this before tomorrow..." He'd been saying that for weeks now, but something always stopped him. Maybe because Julia had once mentioned it made him look like a protagonist from those anime shows Kane was always watching.

The past fortnight felt like a blur - sleeping, studying, meditating, and watching aircraft take off from the hangar with his classmates and the scientist friends they'd made. Dr. Martinez from the biology department had started joining them lately, bringing snacks and telling stories about the early days of Monarch. Sam smiled, remembering how the elderly scientist had nearly choked on his coffee when Kane casually lifted three jets at once with his telekinesis "just to check if I could."

The memory of Miki Saegusa's visit surfaced next. The electric excitement that had coursed through all ten ESP students still lingered in the air weeks later.

"Only three years older than Gerome," Sam mused aloud, remembering how the renowned psychic had shared their experiences of being treated like tools. The sorcery students had watched in bewilderment as the usually composed ESP wing devolved into starstruck chaos.

"You're all so lucky," Miki had told them, her eyes bright with unshed tears. "To have each other from the start. I was alone until Monarch found me."

That visit had sparked another round of rivalry between the two student groups - especially between Suki and Andrew Ford, the top sorcery student. Sam smiled, remembering the constant teasing about how "the best deserve the best." It only served to aggravate both of them further, though Sam swore he'd caught them having civil conversations in the library more than once.

The waves crashed against Castle Bravo's hull far below, a constant reminder of how different life was now. Sam's mind drifted to their rescuers - Godzilla, the imposing figure in black who'd torn apart their underground prison with golden eyes blazing with... something. Sam still couldn't read what the King of Monsters had been thinking that day. Even now, years later, the titan's human form remained an enigma.

Then there was Mothra, who'd nursed them back to health and continued to mother them all. She still visited regularly, bringing baked goods and gentle advice. Just last week she'd taught them how to make proper hot chocolate - "None of that powder nonsense," she'd insisted, her white and gold dress somehow staying spotless despite the chaos of ten psychics trying to cook.

And Battra... Sam glanced at his desk where a framed photo sat. It showed all ten ESP students with their teacher after their first successful group mission. Battra was grinning like a madman, his black and purple robes singed from what he'd claimed was "a slight miscalculation" but what everyone knew was actually a prank gone wrong. They'd helped him get back at Mothra for turning his hair pink while he slept.

"So why am I so terrified?" Sam asked his ceiling. The ceiling, predictably, had no answers.

He tried to pack, he really did. But every item sparked a new question:
- A fresh set of clothes? How long would the mission last?
- His lucky pendant? Would it help or just get in the way?
- The emergency kit Mothra had given each of them? Probably essential, but what did half the items even do?

By midnight, sleep remained elusive. Sam had tried everything - different positions, breathing exercises, counting sheep (and then counting titans, which only made him more anxious). Meditation failed spectacularly; his mind was too scattered to focus.

"This is stupid," he declared to his empty room, throwing off his covers. Without bothering to change out of his night clothes, he slipped out toward the hangar.

The night air hit him like a wall of ice. "Okay, this was definitely stupid," he shivered, but pressed on anyway. The hangar was well-lit against the pitch-black ocean below, unusually empty of its usual bustle.

Sam's psychic senses picked up various minds throughout the facility - night shift workers, scientists burning midnight oil, insomniacs watching terrible movies in their quarters. He caught a glimpse of Kane's thoughts (still watching anime) and quickly pulled back. Battra's rules about privacy were strict, even among classmates.

The hangar itself was deserted, perfect for some illicit wandering. Thanks to Battra's thorough education in the art of pranking (a skill their teacher insisted was essential), Sam knew every camera blind spot in Castle Bravo by heart. He'd helped map them out during what Julia called their "Great Escape Room Caper" - an incident that had ended with three confused security teams, one delighted Battra, and a very unamused Monarch director.

Sam wove through the space with practiced ease, finally settling in an empty area dubbed the "Hanger-Out" by someone with a terrible sense of humor. The name had stuck, much to everyone's chagrin.

The absolute darkness of the ocean below didn't bother him - he'd spent most of his life underground, after all. "Born in darkness," he muttered, then snorted. "God, that sounds so edgy." He could already hear Suki's teasing.

The cool breeze was actually pleasant now that he'd adjusted, and the quiet offered a perfect chance to finally clear his head. Sam closed his eyes, letting his mind drift. Their underground facility had never been truly quiet - always humming with machinery and muttered calculations. Here, the only sounds were the waves and distant machinery.

Until he sensed someone else.

Sam froze just before the entryway to the student residences. His psychic reach detected a presence - male, unfamiliar. Following Battra's rules about not reading thoughts without consent (Mothra found it terribly rude), Sam stuck to surface impressions.

Using his projection abilities - he was one of only six who could do it, and one of three who could manage it at a distance - Sam observed the stranger. The hangar lights revealed ash-blonde hair cut short, broad shoulders, and impressive height. The man wore a simple white shirt and pants, his face half-hidden in shadow as he spoke on the phone.

*Objectively speaking*, Sam thought, trying to stay clinical, *he's attractive*. He moved his projection closer, noting the shadow of stubble along a strong jaw that moved animatedly as the man talked. There was something compelling about the way he held himself - confident but not arrogant, powerful but controlled.

*Stop staring*, Sam scolded himself. *You're as bad as Julia when that new pilot transferred in-*

Suddenly, the stranger paused, looking around sharply. Sam yanked his projection back, but not before catching a glimpse of striking blue eyes that seemed to pierce right through him.

Heart pounding, Sam retreated to his room with all the stealth he could muster. His phone read 2 AM.

"Great," he groaned, flopping onto his bed. "Four hours until dawn." He glanced at the scale in its frame, wondering if Godzilla had ever felt this unprepared for anything.

To his surprise, sleep came easily this time. His last thought before drifting off was that maybe the mission wouldn't be so bad after all.

He had no idea how wrong - or right - that thought would turn out to be.

# Dawn's Early Chaos

The first thing Sam registered was someone slapping his face. Repeatedly.

The second thing was a floating red air horn aimed directly at his head.

"Holy sh-!" Sam yelped, launching himself off the bed only to collide with what felt like a brick wall. The "wall" cursed as they both went down.

"Damn it, Sam!" Nathan clutched his nose while Suki begrudgingly let the air horn drop to the bed.

"I wanted to use it," she pouted. "We never get to use it anymore."

Sam blinked at them blearily, fumbling for his phone. The moment he saw the time, his eyes shot wide open: 5:30 AM.

"Oh no. No, no, no-" Sam bolted for the bathroom, nearly tripping over his own feet. Various toiletries went flying as he scrambled to get ready.

"You were supposed to wake up thirty minutes ago," Suki called through the door. "Battra's not happy."

"When is he ever?" Sam's voice echoed from the shower.

"No, like, actually not happy," Suki leaned against the wall. "Mothra visited last night. Nobody knows what they talked about, but he's been weird all morning."

Nathan picked up the air horn, twirling it thoughtfully. "Also, apparently some guy in the hangar felt someone watching him last night. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"

The sound of bottles crashing in the shower was his only answer.

"We'll wait in the lounge," Suki announced, dragging Nathan away. "Try not to drown yourself!"

Left alone, Sam let his head thunk against the shower wall. *What was I thinking, staying up so late? And since when can't I sense Mothra's presence? Though that probably says more about her power level than mine...*

His mental spiral was interrupted by more crashing bottles. Right. Panic now, existential crisis later.

---

The living room looked like an airport had exploded. Bags, equipment, and various mission gear covered every surface where snacks and gaming consoles usually lived.

"Is he actually awake?" Julia asked as Suki and Nathan entered. "Or did you just leave him unconscious?"

"He's vertical," Nathan confirmed, still rubbing his nose. "Mostly."

The Chen twins appeared in the doorway, both raising identical eyebrows at Sam's absence. "His partner's waiting," they said in perfect unison, which everyone agreed was still creepy even after all this time.

"He'll be here!" Suki projected mentally. As if summoned, Sam burst through one of the side entrances, bags hanging haphazardly off his shoulders, looking like he'd run a marathon.

*Ready or not*, Sam thought as the twins led him toward Central Command, *here we go.*

---

The massive doors of Central Command slid open with unnecessary dramatic flair. Sam immediately spotted his master floating near the center, chatting with Methuselah, the eldest titan who'd taken on janitorial duties (and seemed weirdly happy about it).

Sam braced for a lecture, but Battra merely fixed him with those piercing crimson eyes before gliding back to his position. Methuselah gave a friendly wave before ambling off to... clean something, presumably.

Then Battra did something that made Sam's heart stop. With an exaggerated flourish, he pulled away what looked like invisible cloth, revealing-

*Oh no.*

*Oh NO.*

Standing there, with a scowl that could curdle milk, was the man from the hangar. Up close, he was even more impressive - and intimidating. The stubble was gone, but everything else was exactly as Sam remembered, right down to those striking blue eyes that now regarded him with obvious skepticism.

Battra's grin grew wider. "Samuel Johns, meet your partner - Blaine Carter, US Marine Corps."

Sam wished the floor would swallow him whole. He'd settle for spontaneously developing Methuselah's earth-moving abilities right about now.

Carter's scowl deepened as he sized up the lanky young man before him. This was his partner? This kid who looked like a strong breeze might knock him over? Either this was some cosmic joke or someone at command really had it out for him.

Battra was practically radiating amusement now. "Oh, and one more thing," he added cheerfully. "I'll be tagging along as supervisor."

Sam's prayers for the floor to swallow him intensified.
