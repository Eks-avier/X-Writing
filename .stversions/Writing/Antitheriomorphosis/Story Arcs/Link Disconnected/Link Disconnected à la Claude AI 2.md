# First Phase

The wall rippled like liquid mercury as Battra phased through it, his purple and black robes flowing in a non-existent wind. The ESP students' homeroom – a spacious chamber in Keep Charlie, the mystically-extended wing of Castle Bravo – remained silent save for the gentle hum of the facility's ventilation system.

"Still practicing calculus, Samuel?" Battra's voice carried a hint of amusement as he noticed one of his students hunched over a notebook. "I assure you, the quiz after winter break won't be that difficult."

"That's what you said about the trigonometry test," Kane called out from two rows over, not bothering to look up from his phone. "Sam was the only one who passed that one."

"Barely," Sam mumbled, finally closing his notebook.

Suki Takama stretched in her seat near the front. "Some of us have different priorities, Master. Like making sure our telekinesis doesn't accidentally snap pencils anymore."

"That was one time," Julia protested from the back, her face flushing. "And I fixed the window right after!"

The classroom erupted in light laughter, echoing off walls decorated for the winter season. Strings of twinkling lights traced patterns across the ceiling, their soft glow reflecting off the frosted windows that showed glimpses of the Pacific Ocean beyond. The bulletin board, normally cluttered with training schedules and achievement charts, had been transformed into a winter wonderland complete with paper evergreens and glittering garlands.

"Did Methuselah approve all these decorations?" Battra asked, floating cross-legged before the class. His crimson eyes lingered on the six-foot Christmas tree in the corner, its branches laden with an eclectic mix of baubles, action figures, and – was that candy?

"He helped," Nathan grinned, clearly proud. "Said it was nice to see the place looking lived-in for once. You should see what he did with the sorcery students' wing – their trees actually grow!"

Gerome Marcel, ever the voice of reason, cleared his throat. "Master, you mentioned having announcements?"

"Always so serious, Gerome," Battra sighed dramatically. "Though I suppose if you were all out shopping or whatever it is young people do these days, you wouldn't need that monthly allowance..."

"You wouldn't," Suki narrowed her eyes. "The Queen would never allow it."

"Ah, but my dear sister is currently preoccupied," Battra's grin widened. "As is our King."

The mention of Godzilla and Mothra's absence sent a ripple of curiosity through the room. Sam watched as his classmates exchanged glances, a few surface thoughts slipping through their usual mental barriers – mostly speculation about what could keep both rulers away for months.

"However," Battra continued, his tone shifting to something more serious, "their absence means certain responsibilities fall to others. Which brings us to today's actual purpose." He raised his hand, conjuring a holographic display that hung in the air like a playful ghost. "Three live missions."

The change in atmosphere was immediate. Phones disappeared into pockets, notebooks closed, and all ten students sat straighter in their seats.

"Nothing too difficult," Battra assured them, the hologram beside him showing three distinct groups waiting to be matched with missions. "Covert operations and retrievals, primarily. Though one does involve some illegally refined titan... excrement."

"Excuse me?" Julia's voice cracked. "Did you say-"

"I did, and we'll get to that delightful detail shortly." Battra's hologram expanded, showing a five-four-one split between the groups. "Now, before anyone-"

"One?" Gerome interrupted, something he rarely did. "Master, you can't mean a solo mission."

A chorus of voices filled the room:

"I'll take it," Kane volunteered. "I can multitask better than-"

"No way," Suki cut in. "I'm the strongest telepath here, it should be-"

"We shouldn't split up like that at all-" Nathan started.

"ENOUGH!" Battra's voice, while not loud, carried enough authority to silence the room instantly. The hologram beside him mimicked his raised hand with comical exaggeration. "The assignments have already been set."

Collective groans filled the room, bouncing off the festive decorations in a way that made their dismay seem almost cheerful.

"And," Battra continued, "before you work yourselves into a telepathic tizzy, the solo mission will include military personnel. A marine, to be specific."

The groans transformed into uncomfortable shifting. Sam, still in his back-row seat, felt his stomach twist. Working with non-telepaths was something Battra had been pushing them to practice more – creating mind links with those who couldn't reciprocate required twice the effort and concentration.

"Now then," Battra enlarged the hologram, cute chibi versions of each student floating in the air. "Let's begin with Team One..."

"First team," Battra announced, the hologram expanding to show detailed mission parameters. "Suki Takama, you'll lead."

"Finally," Suki grinned, leaning forward in her seat. Her dark braid slipped over her shoulder as she watched her chibi-self float to the front of the display.

"Sarah Chen, Marcus Webb, and Daniel Foster will join you," Battra continued, their respective chibi versions floating to join Suki's. "Your target is an illegal operation in Mexico. They're manufacturing and distributing an... interesting substance."

"How interesting are we talking?" Marcus asked, running a hand through his short black hair.

"It's derived from refined titan excrement," Battra said with far too much cheerfulness. "Specifically from Behemoth, Guardian of the Amazon."

The reaction was immediate and vocal.

"That's disgusting!" Sarah exclaimed, her face scrunching up.

"Who would even think of that?" Daniel looked genuinely puzzled.

"Better question," Suki interjected, "who's buying it?"

"That," Battra pointed at her, "is exactly what you'll be finding out. The substance is highly addictive and has been making its way not just into the USA, but worldwide."

"Great," Marcus muttered. "Titan-poop drug dealers. Just what I wanted for Christmas."

"Second team," Battra continued, ignoring the continued sounds of disgust. "Gerome Marcel will lead the largest group."

Gerome straightened in his chair, his expression serious as always. His chibi-self floated to a different section of the hologram, soon joined by four others.

"Nathan Phillips, Emma Rodriguez, Julia Chen, and Lisa Foster will accompany you," Battra explained. "Your mission takes you to rural England. We've detected a titan there, likely being held against their will."

"Hold on," Emma raised her hand. "Why do we get the biggest team for a retrieval? Shouldn't Suki's team be larger for a drug bust?"

"The titan's status is unknown," Battra explained. "We don't know if they're passive or aggressive, nor do we know who might be protecting them. Better to be over-prepared."

"I wouldn't mind switching," Marcus offered. "England sounds better than drug lords."

"No exchanges," Battra's smile turned mischievous. "Besides, we haven't revealed our solo mission yet."

The room grew quiet again. Sam, who had been half-listening while reviewing his calculus notes, felt the silence like a physical weight. Kane tapped his shoulder, pointing at the hologram where only one chibi remained.

Sam's brown eyes widened as he watched his chibi-self toddle cheerfully toward the third mission slot. He spun in his seat, meeting the sympathetic gazes of his classmates.

"I'll trade places," Nathan immediately offered. "My persuasion skills could-"

"I could do it," Julia interrupted. "My empathy might-"

"No trades," Battra's voice was firm but gentle. "Samuel needs this experience."

"But-" Sam finally found his voice, though it came out softer than intended.

"The marine assigned to you is highly qualified," Battra assured him. "And..." his smile turned mysterious, "you won't be entirely without supervision."

Before anyone could question that cryptic statement, Battra snapped his fingers. The holographic display condensed into a thin strand of light that shot through the wall, presumably heading for Castle Bravo's central computer. Without another word, their teacher vanished, leaving only a note floating in the air.

Suki caught it with her telekinesis before anyone else could grab it. "All teams depart tomorrow evening," she read aloud through their mental link. "Prepare immediately. Johns – meet your partner at dawn."

"Dawn?" Sam's voice cracked. "But that's-"

"Soon," Gerome finished, already standing. "We should head back to the quarters and help you pack."

As they gathered their things and headed for the Wall Walk – the mystically extended corridor that connected Keep Charlie to the main facility – Sam's classmates surrounded him with offers of help and support.

"I've got spare tactical gear," Gerome offered.

"You'll need snacks," Kane insisted. "You always forget to eat when you're stressed."

"We'll help you pick out clothes," Julia added. "Can't have you looking shabby in front of your new partner."

Sam managed a weak smile, grateful for their support but unable to shake the anxiety building in his chest. As they walked through the Wall Walk, the magical corridor shifting and adjusting around them as it always did, he couldn't help but remember their escape from the underground facility. The fear, the uncertainty...

"Hey," Suki's voice cut through his thoughts, both verbal and mental. "We've got your back. Always."

Sam nodded, trying to believe it. He had no idea that this mission would test that support in ways none of them could imagine.
