# Domestic Fantasy

## Chapter 2: Preparations

Godzilla stood in the center of his quarters, surveying his possessions with a critical eye. The room was spartan by human standards—a bed he rarely used, a desk with three books on military strategy, and a closet containing identical sets of black and white clothing, some of which were just shirts and others were button-downs—all of them were plain, had black tactical slacks to pair with, and made by Mothra using her own silk.

For a being who had lived for millions of years, he had accumulated remarkably little.

Until recently, he hadn't needed possessions. As a Titan, the ocean was his domain, radiation his sustenance, and the planet itself his territory. The concept of personal belongings was… foreign.

He picked up one of the books, weighing it in his hand. Would a high school physics teacher own books on ancient warfare? Probably not. He set it back down.

A knock at his door interrupted his contemplation.

“Come in,” he rumbled.

The door slid open to reveal three Monarch staff members, each carrying empty suitcases and boxes. Behind them stood Mothra, a clipboard in her hands and a gentle smile on her face.

“I thought you might need some help packing,” she said.

Godzilla glanced around the nearly empty room. “I don't need three people to pack five shirts.”

Mothra's smile didn't waver. “Godric Nordson would have more possessions than five shirts. We need to establish a believable life.”

The staff members stood awkwardly in the doorway, clearly intimidated by his presence despite years of working in the same facility. He could smell their nervous sweat.

“Fine,” he grunted, stepping aside. “What exactly am I supposed to bring to this… charade?”

Mothra consulted her clipboard. “Clothes for various occasions. Books that align with your cover story. Personal items that suggest hobbies and interests.” She looked up. “Do you have hobbies or interests?”

The question caught him off guard. Did he? Before the transformation, his existence had been defined by purpose, not leisure. Protect territory. Maintain balance. Sleep when not needed.

“I watch fights sometimes,” he offered. “With Kong.”

Mothra's eyes softened. “I remember. The secret trips to underground boxing matches.” She turned to the staff. “We'll need sports memorabilia. Boxing-related items. Perhaps some fitness equipment.”

The staff members nodded, making notes.

“What else?” she prompted.

Godzilla frowned, uncomfortable with the scrutiny. “I maintain my vehicle.”

“Perfect,” Mothra said. “Tools, manuals, perhaps some automotive magazines.” More notes were taken. “Speaking of your vehicle—”

“It's coming with us,” he stated flatly.

“I assumed as much. I was only going to ask if it needs any preparation before the journey.”

He shook his head. “It's ready.”

Mothra checked something off her list. “Excellent. Now, for your teaching materials—”

“I'm not actually going to teach,” he interrupted.

“You most certainly are,” she countered. “Our cover depends on it. I've arranged for extensive materials on physics education, and Drs. Ilene and Ling Chen has prepared lesson plans suitable for a high school curriculum.”

Godzilla stared at her. “You want me to teach teenagers about physics.”

“Is that more difficult than battling a three-headed alien dragon?”

He had no immediate response to that.

For the next hour, Godzilla watched as his quarters were transformed. Staff members brought in clothes he had never seen—casual wear, formal attire, even workout clothes and sleepwear. Books appeared on topics ranging from physics to classic literature. A collection of vinyl records materialized, along with a small record player.

“Do I like music now?” he asked dryly.

“Godric Nordson appreciates vintage jazz,” Mothra informed him. “It helps him relax after long days of teaching.”

By the time they finished, six suitcases and four boxes stood packed and ready. Godzilla looked at them with something approaching alarm.

“This isn't me,” he said quietly.

A staff member approached tentatively. “Sir, we'll arrange to have these transported to the loading bay—”

“No need,” Godzilla interrupted. He stepped forward, easily lifting all six suitcases at once—three in each hand—as if they weighed nothing. The boxes he stacked and balanced on top, securing the tower with one finger while the staff watched with wide eyes.

“I've got it,” he said simply, striding toward the door which automatically slid open before him.

Mothra dismissed the remaining staff with a nod, waiting until the door closed behind them. “That wasn't necessary,” she said, though her lips curved in amusement.

“It was efficient,” he countered.

“It was showing off,” she corrected gently. “But I understand. This isn't you. Not the real you. It's a version of you that can exist in their world without causing panic. Think of it as camouflage.”

“Deception,” he corrected.

“Adaptation,” she countered gently. “Something we've both done; something you've always excelled at.”

Before he could respond, his phone buzzed. A text from Mark Russell: *Final briefing in 30. Bring your things to loading bay 2.*

Mothra glanced at her own phone. “I should check on my preparations as well. The staff will transport your items.” She paused at the door. “Is there anything here—anything of your own—that you want to bring? Something not on the lists?”

Godzilla considered the question. After a moment's hesitation, he walked to his bed and reached beneath it, pulling out a small wooden box. He opened it, revealing a single scale—obsidian black with hints of blue, roughly the size of his palm.

“From my true form,” he explained, though he wasn't sure why he felt the need to. “The first piece that fell after the transformation.”

Mothra nodded, understanding in her eyes. “I'll see you at the briefing,” she said softly, leaving him alone with his memories.

---

Loading Bay 2 buzzed with activity. Monarch personnel moved efficiently around the massive space, preparing vehicles and equipment. In the center of it all sat Godzilla's truck—an imposing black pickup with custom reinforced suspension and slightly tinted windows. The vehicle was almost comically large, dwarfing the standard Monarch SUVs parked nearby.

Godzilla approached it, running a hand along the hood. The truck had been a necessity after the third time he and Kong had destroyed a Monarch vehicle during one of their boxing excursions. Dr. Stanton had offered to modify it to run on Godzilla's own atomic energy, but he had declined. Something about the ritual of filling it with fuel, of performing regular maintenance, appealed to him. Perhaps because it was so unnecessary—so human.

“You're really bringing that monstrosity?”

Godzilla turned to find Dr. Mark Russell eyeing the truck with disapproval.

“Yes,” he said simply.

“We could provide something less… conspicuous.”

“No.”

Mark sighed. “Fine. But try not to intimidate the entire town with it.”

Godzilla almost smiled. Almost. “Where's Mothra?”

“Still packing, I imagine. She's bringing half of Castle Bravo with her.”

As if summoned by her name, Mothra appeared at the entrance to the loading bay. Unlike Godzilla's brute force approach, she employed a different kind of spectacle. A procession of suitcases, boxes, craft supplies, and what appeared to be a loom floated serenely through the air around her, suspended by her telekinetic ability. The items orbited her like planets around a sun, perfectly arranged and never touching. Her platinum blonde hair was pulled back in a simple ponytail, and she wore a flowing blue dress that seemed to shimmer in the light.

“Sorry I'm late,” she said, not looking remotely apologetic as she guided her floating possessions into the bay with gentle hand gestures. “I couldn't decide which yarns to bring.”

Monarch personnel stopped what they were doing to stare at the elegant display of psychic power. One young technician nearly walked into a support beam, transfixed by the sight.

Mark stared at the mountain of luggage now gently settling into neat piles. “You do realize this is a covert operation, not a permanent relocation?”

“A proper cover requires attention to detail,” she replied. “Maria Nordson is an art teacher who specializes in textiles. I can hardly teach without materials.”

Godzilla eyed the loom skeptically. “Is that made from your silk?”

“Of course. All my best creations are.” She gestured to her dress. “Including this. Do you like it?”

Before he could answer—not that he had any idea how to respond to such a question—the bay doors opened, and a familiar figure sauntered in, purple robes swirling dramatically around him.

“Ah, the happy couple prepares for domestic bliss,” Battra announced, his voice carrying across the entire loading bay. “How utterly charming.”

Godzilla suppressed a groan. “Is your brother always going to make an entrance?”

“Always,” Mothra confirmed with a fond smile.

Battra floated over, arms laden with packages wrapped in shimmering paper. “Wedding gifts!” he proclaimed. “Well, technically housewarming, but since this will be your first home together as the blissful Nordsons, I thought it appropriate.”

“We don't need gifts,” Godzilla stated flatly.

“Nonsense! Every new couple needs the essentials.” Battra thrust the packages at them. “Go on, open them now. I want to see your faces.”

Mark checked his watch. “We don't really have time for—”

“Oh, there's always time for presents,” Battra interrupted, waving his hand dismissively. “The cosmic forces of chaos and destruction can wait five minutes.”

With obvious reluctance, Godzilla accepted the top package. The paper dissolved at his touch, revealing a welcome mat emblazoned with “The Nordsons” in ornate script.

“For your front door,” Battra explained unnecessarily. “I had it specially made. Enchanted, of course. It alerts you if anyone with malicious intent crosses the threshold.”

Mothra opened the next package, which contained two coffee mugs. One read “Hers” in delicate lettering. The other simply said “Grumpy” with a cartoon face that bore a suspicious resemblance to Godzilla.

“How thoughtful,” she said diplomatically.

The final package was the largest. When the paper melted away, Godzilla found himself holding two matching bathrobes—plush, white, and monogrammed with “G” and “M” respectively.

“For those cozy mornings together,” Battra said with an exaggerated wink. “Every married couple needs proper loungewear.”

Godzilla stared at the robe in his hands, then at Battra, then at Mothra, whose cheeks had taken on a distinctly pink hue.

“Thank you, brother,” she said quickly. “We should pack these away now. Mark is right—we're on a schedule.”

Battra floated backward, clearly pleased with the discomfort he'd caused. “Of course, of course. Far be it from me to delay true love's mission.” He made a sweeping bow. “I'll be checking in regularly, so do keep the guest room tidy.”

With that, he vanished in a puff of purple smoke, leaving the scent of lavender lingering in the air.

Mark cleared his throat. “If the theatrics are finished, perhaps we can go over the final details?”

For the next twenty minutes, they reviewed their cover stories, emergency protocols, and communication schedules. A small crowd had gathered at the periphery of the loading bay—Monarch staff and some of Battra's students, ostensibly there to assist but clearly curious about the mission.

As Mark wrapped up his briefing, the bay doors opened again. This time, a tall, broad-shouldered man with wild hair strode in, a look of excitement on his face.

“G-man!” Kong called out. “Ready to—”

He stopped abruptly, taking in the packed truck, the luggage, and the assembled crowd. His expression shifted from enthusiasm to confusion.

“What's going on?” he asked, looking around. “Did I miss something?”

An awkward silence fell over the loading bay. Staff members suddenly found their clipboards fascinating. Battra's students shuffled their feet. Mark looked like he'd swallowed something unpleasant.

“You didn't tell him,” Mothra said quietly to Godzilla, not a question but a statement.

Godzilla's jaw tightened. He hadn't told Kong about the mission because… well, he wasn't entirely sure why. Perhaps because saying it aloud would make it real. Perhaps because Kong would inevitably make jokes about playing house. Perhaps because a small, irrational part of him had hoped something would come up to cancel the whole operation.

“Tell me what?” Kong demanded, striding closer. “And why are you packing? The fight's tomorrow night!”

“What fight?” Mark asked.

“Silva versus Thompson! Heavyweight championship! We've had tickets for weeks!” Kong looked at Godzilla accusingly. “Don't tell me you forgot.”

“I didn't forget,” Godzilla said evenly.

“Then what—” Kong's eyes widened as understanding dawned. “You're bailing. You're actually bailing on the fight of the year.”

“Something came up.”

“Something came up,” Kong repeated incredulously. “What could possibly be more important than—” He finally noticed Mothra standing beside the truck, surrounded by luggage. His mouth formed a perfect O of realization. “Oh. *Oh*. You two are…” He made a vague gesture between them.

“It's not what you think,” Godzilla growled.

“It's exactly what he thinks,” Battra's voice announced from somewhere unseen. “They're playing newlyweds in a charming little town. Very romantic.”

“We're on a mission,” Godzilla corrected, glaring at the ceiling where Battra's voice seemed to be coming from. “Ghidorah fragment. Undercover work.”

Kong's expression cycled through confusion, realization, and finally, unbridled delight. A slow grin spread across his face.

“You,” he pointed at Godzilla, “and you,” he pointed at Mothra, “are going undercover. As a couple.” He looked around the loading bay, as if seeking confirmation that he wasn't hallucinating.

“As teachers,” Mothra clarified. “In a small town where we suspect a Ghidorah fragment has been hidden.”

Kong nodded solemnly, though his eyes were dancing with mirth. “Of course. Very serious mission. Absolutely critical.” He managed to maintain his composure for approximately three more seconds before bursting into laughter so loud it echoed throughout the bay.

“I need a new sparring partner,” Godzilla muttered.

“Oh no, buddy, you're not getting rid of me that easily,” Kong said between laughs. “This is the best thing I've heard all year.” He wiped his eyes. “So, what's your cover story? Let me guess—you're a grumpy gym teacher and she's a… what, guidance counselor?”

“Physics teacher and art instructor,” Mark supplied, checking his watch again. “And we really need to get moving.”

Kong nodded, still grinning. “Oh yeah, sure, don't let me keep you.” He clapped Godzilla on the shoulder. “Good luck playing human, G-man. Try not to scare the children.”

Godzilla shrugged off his hand. “We need to go.”

“Wait, wait,” Kong insisted. “You need advice. Marriage advice.”

“No, we don't,” Godzilla stated firmly.

“Yes, you do. Listen, I've seen like, five romantic movies. I know how this works.” Kong adopted a serious expression that fooled no one. “First, always agree with your wife. Even when she's wrong—*especially* when she's wrong.”

“That's terrible advice,” Mothra observed mildly.

“See? I've offended her already. That's strike one for you, buddy.” Kong was clearly enjoying himself immensely. “Second, humans expect married people to touch each other. Like, all the time. Hand-holding, shoulder-touching, those weird little kisses they do when greeting each other.”

Godzilla felt the beginnings of a headache forming behind his eyes. “Are you finished?”

“Not even close. Third—and this is the most important—you need pet names. Humans go crazy for that stuff. 'Honey,' 'sweetheart,' 'sugar scales'—”

“Sugar scales?” Mothra repeated, raising an eyebrow.

“I'm improvising,” Kong admitted. “The point is, you can't just call each other 'Mothra' and 'Godzilla' or your cover's blown.”

“We know our cover names,” Godzilla growled.

“But do you know how to act married?” Kong pressed. “Have you practiced your loving gazes? Your casual domestic banter? Your synchronized sighing when your annoying brother-in-law visits unexpectedly?”

The last comment was punctuated by another puff of purple smoke as Battra fully materialized beside Kong. “I resent that accurate characterization,” he sniffed.

Mark stepped between them all. “Enough. The transport window closes in fifteen minutes. We need to load the vehicles and depart.” He pointed to the staff. “Secure the luggage. Dr. Chen will provide final documentation.”

As everyone scrambled to follow his orders, Kong pulled Godzilla aside. “Seriously though,” he said, voice lowered, “you're going to be okay with this? Playing house with Mothra?”

There was genuine concern beneath the teasing, something few besides Godzilla would recognize in Kong's expression.

“It's a mission,” Godzilla replied evenly. “Nothing more.”

Kong studied him for a moment, then nodded. “If you say so.” He glanced over at Mothra, who was helping arrange her craft supplies in the truck bed. “Just… be careful, alright? Not with the Ghidorah thing. With the…” he waved his hand vaguely, “feelings thing.”

Before Godzilla could respond—not that he had any idea how to respond to that—Kong slapped him on the back and raised his voice again. “I'll save your ticket for the rematch!” he called out. “Unless you're too busy with PTA meetings and suburban barbecues by then!”

The loading bay erupted in poorly concealed laughter, which died immediately when Godzilla turned his gaze on the crowd. Even Monarch veterans who had worked with him for years still wilted under that golden stare.

“We're ready,” Mothra announced, walking over to join them. She had changed into a more casual outfit—jeans and a flowing white blouse that somehow managed to look both simple and elegant.

Godzilla nodded, turning away from Kong. “Let's go.”

As they walked toward the truck, Kong called after them: “Don't forget to send a postcard! 'Greetings from Domestic Bliss!'”

Godzilla opened the driver's door, pausing to look back at the loading bay. At Kong's grinning face. At Mark's concerned expression. At Battra floating above them all with an infuriating smirk. At the students watching with wide-eyed fascination.

“It's just a mission,” he reminded himself quietly.

Beside him, Mothra slipped into the passenger seat, arranging her flowing outfit carefully. “Ready?” she asked, her voice gentle.

He nodded once, starting the engine. The truck's powerful rumble filled the loading bay, drowning out Kong's continued commentary and the whispers of the onlookers.

As they drove out through the massive doors and onto the carrier deck where a transport waited to take them to the mainland, neither spoke. The silence wasn't uncomfortable—they had known each other too long for that—but there was a new tension humming beneath it. An awareness of boundaries about to be crossed, of a performance about to begin.

“Godric and Maria Nordson,” Mothra said finally, testing the names. “Married physics and art teachers.”

“This won't work,” Godzilla replied.

She turned to look at him, sunlight catching in her platinum hair. “Why not?”

“Because no one will believe I'm a teacher. Or a husband.”

A smile touched her lips. “You'd be surprised what humans believe when it's what they expect to see.” She reached out, briefly touching his arm—a gesture so casual yet so unfamiliar that it sent an odd current through him. “Besides, we've defended Earth together for millions of years. How hard can one small-town mission be?”

Godzilla said nothing, but as the transport carried them toward their new temporary life, he couldn't shake the feeling that this mission would test him in ways that fighting Ghidorah never had.

And somewhere in the loading bay, Battra was still laughing.
