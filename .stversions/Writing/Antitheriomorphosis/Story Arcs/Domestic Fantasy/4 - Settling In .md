# Domestic Fantasy

## Chapter 4: Settling In

The front door closed with a soft click, sealing them inside their new temporary home. They stood in the entryway, still close enough that their shoulders nearly touched, as they surveyed their surroundings.

The interior was pleasant if unremarkable—neutral walls, hardwood floors, and furniture that appeared to have been selected from a catalog of “inoffensive suburban decor.” A living room opened to the right, dining area and kitchen to the left, with stairs directly ahead leading to the second floor.

“Monarch furnished it,” Mothra observed, moving further inside. Her fingertips trailed along the back of a beige sofa as she passed. “Aggressively normal.”

Godzilla remained by the door, scanning the space with tactical precision. “Two exits on the ground floor. Windows in every room. Sight lines to the street and the neighbors.”

“Are you planning an assault or moving in?” she asked, amusement in her voice.

“Habit,” he replied simply.

Mothra nodded, understanding better than anyone his instinct to assess and secure territory. She'd seen him do the same whether entering a battlefield or a conference room. Some behaviors transcended physical form.

“We should unload the truck,” he said, already turning back toward the door.

“Wait.” She moved to the windows facing the street, peering through the blinds. “Barbara is still in her garden. And now there's another neighbor speaking with her.”

Even from inside, they could see the animated conversation, the furtive glances toward their house.

“If we unload now, we'll have an audience,” Mothra continued. “Better to wait until dark, when we can bring in certain items without observation.”

By “certain items,” she meant the specialized Monarch equipment hidden among their personal belongings—sensors designed to detect Ghidorah's unique energy signature, specialized containment units, and various defensive technologies disguised as ordinary household objects.

Godzilla inclined his head in agreement, then resumed his methodical exploration of the ground floor. Mothra watched him move through the space, his powerful frame making the ordinary furniture appear somehow diminished. Seeing him in this domestic setting—the King of Monsters in a suburban home—struck her as both incongruous and oddly fitting. For all his power, he'd always been an adaptive creature.

“We should establish the house rules,” he said abruptly, returning to the living room where she stood.

“House rules?” she repeated.

“Parameters for maintaining our cover while completing the mission efficiently.” He crossed his arms, his expression serious. “Division of responsibilities. Sleeping arrangements. Communication protocols.”

Mothra smiled faintly. “You make it sound like a military operation.”

“It is,” he countered. “With civilian components.”

“Very well.” She settled gracefully onto the sofa, gesturing for him to join her. After a moment's hesitation, he sat in an armchair opposite her—maintaining distance while still engaging in the conversation. “What are your concerns?”

Godzilla leaned forward slightly, elbows on his knees. “The bedroom situation.”

Of course that would be his first concern, Mothra thought. “I examined the floor plans. There are three bedrooms upstairs. The master and two smaller rooms.”

“We should each take one of the smaller rooms,” he stated. “The master remains for appearance only—in case of visitors.”

Mothra tilted her head, considering him. “That would look strange, wouldn't it? A married couple with separate bedrooms?”

“We're not actually married,” he reminded her, his voice low despite the fact that they were alone.

“No, but we're supposed to appear as if we are.” She folded her hands in her lap. “I'm not suggesting we share a bed, Godzilla. But the master bedroom should look lived-in. Used. If someone were to come in—”

“Why would anyone come into our bedroom?”

“Maintenance workers. Neighbors bringing casseroles when one of us is ill. Battra materializing unexpectedly, as he's prone to do,” she listed patiently. “The point is, we need to maintain appearances in all areas of the house, not just the public spaces.”

Godzilla frowned, but didn't argue further. “Then we make it appear lived-in. But we maintain private sleeping quarters.”

“Agreed.” Mothra rose from the sofa. “Let's see exactly what we're working with.”

They ascended the stairs together, the old wood creaking beneath Godzilla's weight. The upper floor held the three bedrooms Mothra had mentioned, along with a bathroom and a small sitting area at the top of the stairs.

The master bedroom was spacious by human standards, with a king-sized bed, dual nightstands, and an attached bath. Like the rest of the house, it was furnished with bland but functional pieces, the color scheme an inoffensive blend of blues and grays.

“Your silk sheets would look appropriate here,” Godzilla observed, surprising her with his attention to detail.

“They would,” she agreed. “And perhaps your record player on that dresser.”

They moved to inspect the smaller bedrooms. One had been set up as a home office, with a desk and bookshelves. The other contained a simple twin bed and a small dresser.

“I'll take this one,” Godzilla said, indicating the office. “I can move the mattress from the other room in here.”

Mothra considered the space. “You'll need to soundproof it,” she said. “You tend to emit radiation when you sleep deeply.”

He glanced at her, a question in his eyes.

“I've observed it at Castle Bravo,” she explained. “The readings spike during your sleep cycle. Nothing dangerous, but noticeable on sensitive equipment. If Barbara next door owns a Geiger counter, we might have some explaining to do.”

“I'll contain it,” he said simply.

The final bedroom—the smallest—would be Mothra's actual sleeping space. She examined it with practical eyes, already planning adjustments.

“This will work,” she decided. “I don't need much space.”

A smile ghosted across her lips as she remembered her chamber on Infant Island—a vast cavern adorned with ancient murals and offerings from generations of human worshippers. How strange that this tiny human bedroom would now be her sanctuary.

“We should continue planning downstairs,” she suggested. “Away from the windows.”

Back in the living room, Godzilla resumed his seat while Mothra paced slowly, her natural grace making the movement appear almost like floating.

“Division of household tasks,” she began. “I assume you'll handle any necessary vehicle maintenance.”

He nodded. “And security.”

“I'll manage the cooking, then. Cleaning can be shared.” She paused. “We should establish a search pattern for locating the fragment.”

“Concentric circles,” Godzilla proposed immediately. “Starting from the school where we'll have regular access. I can sense Ghidorah's energy signature at close range.”

“As can I,” Mothra reminded him. “But we need to be methodical. The fragment could be anywhere—a student's home, a shop, even buried somewhere in the town.”

“If it were active, we would have detected it already,” Godzilla reasoned. “Which means it's dormant. Contained somehow.”

Mothra nodded, appreciating his analytical approach. For all his reputation as a creature of pure force, Godzilla had always possessed a tactical mind.

“We should establish regular sweep patterns,” she suggested. “Morning runs before school. Evening walks afterward. Weekend errands to cover the business district.”

“And we check in with Monarch weekly,” he added. “More frequently if we discover anything significant.”

The planning continued as daylight faded outside, the two ancient beings mapping out routines and contingencies for their most unusual mission. To anyone observing through the windows, they might have appeared to be any couple settling into a new home—discussing schedules, arranging living spaces, planning their days.

As twilight deepened, Godzilla rose from his chair. “We should unload the truck now.”

Mothra peered through the blinds again. “The street seems quiet. Barbara has finally gone inside.”

Under cover of darkness, they efficiently transferred their belongings from the truck to the house. Godzilla carried multiple boxes and suitcases at once, while Mothra used subtle telekinesis to float the more delicate items. They worked in near-perfect synchronization, a coordination born from millions of years of knowing each other's movements.

The last item was Mothra's loom, which they set up in a corner of the living room.

“Do humans actually use these anymore?” Godzilla asked, eyeing the wooden frame skeptically.

“Some do. Artisanal crafts are experiencing a resurgence,” Mothra explained. “Besides, I genuinely enjoy weaving. It's… meditative.”

He watched as she ran her fingers over the wooden frame, a distant look in her eyes. He knew that expression—she was remembering.

“You had looms on Infant Island,” he said quietly. “Your priestesses used them.”

She nodded, surprised that he had noticed such a detail. “They wove ceremonial garments from my silk. Beautiful things.” A shadow crossed her face. “Like the Atlanteans with their tapestries. All lost now.”

The mention of Atlantis hung in the air between them. A civilization that had flourished under their protection, then fallen despite it. One of many they had outlived.

“They were doomed by their own ambition,” Godzilla said, his tone neither harsh nor gentle—simply matter-of-fact. “As were many before them.”

“I should have done more,” Mothra replied, her fingers still tracing patterns on the loom. “Guided them better.”

“You did what was possible. What was right.” He turned away, moving toward the kitchen. “No species can escape its nature. Not even ours.”

The statement lingered as he left the room. Mothra remained by the loom, contemplating his words. Even after countless millennia together, he could still surprise her with moments of unexpected wisdom.

Later, as they prepared for their first night in the house, Godzilla dragged the mattress from the small bedroom into the office, setting it in the corner furthest from any shared walls. With methodical precision, he arranged sheets and a blanket—the motions stiff, as if he rarely made a bed. Which, Mothra realized, he probably didn't. Castle Bravo's staff likely handled such tasks.

“I've placed a subtle barrier around this room,” she told him from the doorway. “It should contain any energy emissions while you sleep.”

He looked up, surprised. “When did you do that?”

“While you were securing the perimeter. For the third time,” she added with a hint of amusement.

“The fence gate was loose,” he said defensively.

“I know.” She leaned against the doorframe, watching him struggle with a pillowcase. “Here, let me.”

Before he could object, she crossed to him and took the pillow, expertly slipping the case over it with a practiced motion. Their fingers brushed briefly during the exchange—a casual contact that nonetheless sent a subtle current between them. For beings who had primarily interacted as massive Titans, these human-scale touches still carried an unexpected intimacy.

“The master bedroom is prepared,” she said, stepping back to a more comfortable distance. “It looks appropriately lived-in should anyone need to see it.”

Godzilla nodded. “Tomorrow we begin our search pattern. First day of classes is Monday.”

“Are you nervous?” she asked. “About teaching?”

He gave her a look that would have intimidated most beings into immediate retreat. “No.”

“It's alright if you are,” she pressed gently. “It's a new experience.”

“I've faced radioactive serpents from beneath the Earth. Psychic crustaceans from the depths of space. Three-headed dragons that consumed stars.” His voice was deadpan. “I think I can handle teenagers.”

Mothra laughed—a sound like wind chimes that seemed to lighten the very air around them. “We'll see,” she said, her eyes twinkling. “Teenagers can be more terrifying than any Titan.”

She turned to leave, pausing at the doorway. “Goodnight, Godzilla.”

“Goodnight, Mothra.” His voice was low, almost soft.

She had nearly closed the door when his voice came again:

“Mothra.”

She looked back at him questioningly.

“When we're outside this house,” he said, “I'm Godric. And you're Maria.”

She smiled gently. “Of course. But in here, when it's just us, we can still be ourselves.”

He considered this, then gave a single nod of agreement.

“Goodnight, then,” she said again.

“Goodnight… Maria.”

The correction surprised her. His blue eyes met hers steadily, conveying a silent message: even in private, they needed to maintain their cover—practice becoming these new versions of themselves until it felt natural.

With a small nod of understanding, she closed the door.

In her own room, Mothra prepared for sleep with practiced human movements that had become second nature over the years of transformation. As she settled onto her bed, she extended her senses outward, feeling the quiet pulse of life around them—the neighbors in their homes, small creatures in the gardens, the subtle energies of the Earth itself beneath the town.

And there, in the room down the hall, the familiar, powerful presence of Godzilla—constant companion throughout eons, now closer than he had ever been, yet somehow still maintaining the same careful distance he always had.

Meadowvale slept, unaware of the ancient guardians now dwelling in its midst. Somewhere within its boundaries, a fragment of terrible power lay hidden, waiting to be found. And in a blue house on Maple Street, two beings who had witnessed the rise and fall of continents prepared to navigate their most challenging mission yet: pretending to be ordinary.

Tomorrow, the search would begin. Tonight, they rested—two Titans playing house, already blurring the lines between performance and truth
