# Drop Off

I can't stay. I don't belong here.

Not even for me?

I can't belong here.

You wouldn't do it for me?

Mari, I can't.

You won't.

What makes you think that? You think I can just waltz in and say I willingly whisked the Princess of the Eclipse away? What do you think they'll do to me? To you…?

Willingly…?

Maria, we're running out of time. You need to go.

You did all that because you wanted to?

Maria… I…

I can't leave you here. I don't want you to go back to this… this life. Running around, thieving, and risking your life everyday.

I don't—.

I don't CARE. These past months were the best I've ever had. They were yours too, weren't they?

… (She had always loved those golden eyes of his; she knew the way they looked at her *that night*)

You're not so hard to read after all, I realized. Your eyes tend to betray you.

You don't know me.

I don't. But the man I fell in love with, the man I saw that night… felt that night. I know him well. All that tough talk of yours that day? I know you were just too afraid. But you weren't afraid to make your wants known to me. What you are afraid of—

… (He gives her a kiss; his final one, a parting gift)

Wh…

… (She pulls him closer; he's not the only one who sends a parting gift)

I'm not afraid of you, to love you. I am afraid *for* you. I'm afraid of ruining your future because you allowed yourself to elope with some random glorified thief you met in a forest. I don't belong in your world, and never will. Now *go*.

What happens with shouldering responsibility then? If I were to be with child—

You won't. I made sure of it. Get out of here, **now**.
