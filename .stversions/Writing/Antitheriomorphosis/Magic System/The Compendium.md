## Primus: The Foundation of Magic

### Fundamental Nature

Primus exists as the fifth fundamental force of nature alongside gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force. Unlike other stable cosmic forces, Primus exists in a perpetually unstable state, continuously seeking transformation. It permeates the cosmos as the raw essence of all magical phenomena, governing supernatural manifestations across reality.

### Transformation Process

All magic fundamentally operates through the structured conversion of Primus into specific energy forms. Contact with a sorcerer's soul involuntarily transforms raw Primus into Structured Primus, its stable and usable form. 

Battra alone possesses the ability to halt this transformation process, enabling manipulation of Primus in its raw state. However, its absurd demands of skill to be used at even just a baseline level, along with its unprecedented nature, makes it an incredibly difficult skill for even the Lord of the Mystic Arts to grasp.

### Soul Interaction

The soul serves as both catalyst and stabilizer, shaping raw Primus into specific magical patterns. Soul strength directly corresponds to refinement capability, with stronger souls producing more efficient and controlled magical effects. Certain species (including _[[Titanus Gojira]]_) lack the innate capacity to perceive or manipulate Primus, classified as “Null.” Each sorcerer shapes Primus uniquely according to their soul's individual nature, making magic an inherently personal expression.

### Primus Ignition

Primus Ignition is the preliminary phase of spellcasting where raw Primus is gathered and converted to Structured Primus. Ignition speed varies proportionally with expertise—masters achieve instantaneous ignition. This phase necessarily precedes visualization and verbal components, constituting the foundational phase of all magical practice. Advanced practitioners (notably Battra) can sense the ignition spark in other sorcerers, enabling spell detection before formal casting.

### Commitment Influence

Commitments modify Primus behavior within spells, reinforcing magical structure. Violation of established Commitments introduces instability in Primus-based magic, potentially resulting in spell failure or unintended effects.

### Cosmic Context

Most civilizations throughout the universe naturally perceive and integrate Primus into their societies. Approaches to Primus range from scientific (spell refinement through research) to religious (divine manifestation). Battra stands as the most efficient sorcerer in existence, having refined Primus manipulation to its theoretical limit, achieving perfect magical optimization.

## The Art of Commitments

Commitments are among the most fundamental forces in the world of Sorcery. Once thought to be exclusive to sorcerers, it was later discovered that even those who are Null may be able to invoke them. All that is required is an indomitable soul.

Commitments function as structured abstractions over Primus, the 5th fundamental force of nature. They shape and stabilize Primus, which is inherently unstable and seeks transformation. If a Commitment is broken, Primus mutates unpredictably—often leading to catastrophic consequences.

### The Two Types of Commitments

1. **Self-Commitments** (Personal, Less Severe Punishments)
    - Contracts → Loss of bonus effect or enhancement
    - Promises → Temporary curse
    - Oaths → Loss of identity and power
    - Vows → Permanent curse, proportional to the soul's strength—may or may not be survivable
    - Covenants → No punishment

2. **Mutual Commitments** (Shared, More Severe Punishments)
    - Contracts → Punishment is whatever is written in the Contract
    - Promises → Permanent curse
    - Oaths → Collective loss of identity and power
    - Vows → Guaranteed, unpredictable death
    - Covenants → Impossible to break

### The Five Commitments in Detail

#### 1. Contracts – The Foundation of Sorcery

Contracts are the most common and flexible Commitment, serving as a core technique in sorcery.

- Contracts shape and stabilize Primus, acting like a structured spell-enhancement framework
- Mutual Contracts are transactional—if one party fails, they suffer the agreed-upon consequence
- Self-Contracts allow a sorcerer to draw upon their full magical expertise, reinforcing their spells beyond what they can consciously recall
- Breaking a Contract collapses the structured magic instantly, like a toppled Jenga tower
- Contracts can stabilize experimental spells, but only the known portions—leaving unknown elements unpredictable
- Conflicting Contracts interact sequentially, like buffs and debuffs in a MOBA game
- Contracts can be layered, but without mastery, it can lead to reckless layering that can destabilize magic and harm the user

#### 2. Promises – The Power of Conviction

Promises are unique because they do not rely on magical ability, but on sheer belief.

- Anyone can make a Promise, including Null individuals
- Breaking a Promise always results in a Curse on the promiser
- The severity of the Curse depends on the strength of the broken Promise
- Null individuals are completely vulnerable to Curses from Broken Promises
- A Null's Promise can unintentionally generate magic if their conviction is absolute
- While rare, a Null's Promise can last for generations, but only if they are long-lived or immortal
- Sorcerers are wary of Nulls making Promises—not because they always cause magic, but because the Null themselves is terrifying if fully committed

#### 3. Oaths – Binding Duty and Identity

Oaths are Commitments of allegiance, sworn duty, and identity. Unlike Promises, which are personal, and Vows, which are soul-bound, Oaths connect individuals to a larger cause, group, or purpose.

- Breaking an Oath results in Oathbreaker Status—disabling magic and the ability to make new Commitments
- Mutual Oaths, when broken, erase the group's collective legacy and power
- Oathbreaker status can only be removed by:
    - A master sorcerer, often requiring a Vow in return
    - Genuine redemption—if the Oathbreaker attempts to fulfill their Oath in earnest
- Different cultures punish Oathbreakers with exile, death, or ritual cleansing

#### 4. Vows – The Ultimate Personal Commitment

Vows are the strongest personal Commitments, directly tied to the soul.

- Vows persist beyond death—unlike other Commitments
- Breaking a Vow results in random, often ironic, punishments decided by the Heavens
- The only certainty is that breaking a Mutual Vow results in death
- For personal Vows, breaking one results in a Curse—scaled in severity based on the strength of the Vow
- The unpredictability of punishment makes Vows terrifying—there is no fairness, only fate

#### 5. Covenants – The Divine Agreement

Covenants are the strongest and rarest type of Commitment, formed only between a Mortal and a Divine.

- Covenants cannot be broken—attempting to do so results in ultimate damnation
- Only known Covenant: Titanus Mosura traded magic for immortality

### Legendary Vows – Godzilla and Mothra

Among all known Vows, none are as unbreakable as the one sworn between Godzilla and Mothra.

- Despite being Null, their souls are so powerful that their Vow has become unbreakable
- Some believe this is due to Mothra's divine nature, while others attribute it to Godzilla's sheer strength of character
- If either tries to act against the Vow, they experience the sensation of being “chained in place”—they physically cannot move or act
- Terms of Their Vow:
    - Godzilla rules all Titans. Mothra cannot object to his decisions on Titan affairs
    - Mothra rules human affairs. Godzilla cannot override her objections or ignore her pleas
    - 2020 Amendment: Neither can act for or against humanity unless both consent
- How Others View Their Vow:
    - Titans: Godzilla enforces his rule as the singular Alpha, while Mothra ignores Titan politics, making her unpopular among lesser Titans
    - Humans: Frustrated—because neither can act for or against them without the other's consent
    - Expression of the Vow:
        - “I consent!” → One agrees, but the other must still decide
        - “I do not consent!” → One blocks the other from acting
        - “We consent!” → Both agree, allowing action to proceed
    - Exception: If humans _directly_ interfere in Titan affairs, Godzilla can punish them freely—Mothra loses her say. Likewise, if a Titan _directly_ puts humanity in danger, she is compelled to discipline it.

## Spellcasting Fundamentals

Spellcasting is the act of transforming Primus into a controlled magical effect through the will of the sorcerer. This process is not instantaneous—it follows a structured, universal sequence that ensures stability and efficiency. Every civilization, species, and sorcerer must follow these rules, though skill and mastery affect execution speed and complexity.

### The Four Phases of Spellcasting

Magic must pass through four structured stages before manifesting in reality. Skipping or failing a step results in failure or instability.

| Phase                        | Description                                                  | Effect of Mastery                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Primus Ignition           | The soul gathers and converts Primus into usable magic       | Speed increases with experience; beginners have noticeable delays in Ignition |
| 2. Visualization             | The caster mentally constructs the spell's form and function | More vivid visualization = more stable spell                                  |
| 3. Incantation/Chant/Writing | The verbal or written activation of the spell                | Advanced sorcerers shorten or eliminate this phase                            |
| 4. Execution                 | The spell manifests in the real world                        | Higher mastery = faster, more powerful, and more controlled execution         |

### Primus Ignition: The First & Most Critical Step

Before any spell is cast, the caster must first gather Primus and convert it into usable energy. This process is called Primus Ignition and precedes even visualization.

**How Primus Ignition Works:**

1. The sorcerer's soul draws in Primus from the environment
2. Primus is converted into magical energy, which is then shaped into a spell
3. Ignition speed varies based on mastery—beginners take longer, while advanced sorcerers can do this near-instantaneously

**Primus Ignition Tiers: Speed & Efficiency**

| Tier                  | Ignition Speed                                                               | Who Has It?                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Delayed Ignition      | Takes longer than normal; the caster struggles to convert Primus efficiently | Novices, humans new to sorcery                |
| Stable Ignition       | Optimized conversion speed; most spells cast at an expected rate             | Competent sorcerers, most alien civilizations |
| Near-instant Ignition | No perceptible delay; the spell begins forming the moment it is willed       | Masters like Battra                           |

### Visualization: The Mind Shapes the Spell

Once Primus has been gathered and converted into energy, the sorcerer must shape it mentally. The strength of visualization determines the stability and power of the spell.

**Why Visualization is Key:**

- Without proper visualization, spells become unstable
- A vague mental image results in weaker or malformed magic
- Experienced sorcerers can visualize more complex spells with higher accuracy

**Visualization Complexity:**

|Level|Visualization Quality|Effect on Spell|
|---|---|---|
|Weak Visualization|Fuzzy, unclear intent|Unstable or incomplete spell|
|Basic Visualization|Clear but lacks precision|Weaker effect, but functional|
|Advanced Visualization|Detailed, vivid image|Full power and efficiency|
|Battra's Level|Absolute precision|Perfect efficiency, no waste|

### Execution: Bringing the Spell into Reality

 Once the spell is activated, it manifests physically.
 
- If the sorcerer is advanced enough, then he may _embed_ other effects into the spell long after it has been executed.

**Factors Affecting Spell Execution:**

- A well-optimized spell executes quickly with little to no delay.
- Poor visualization or unstable Primus conversion can result in:
    - Weaker effects
    - Unintended transformations
    - Spell backfire

---

## Chants & Incantations

Chants and Incantations are fundamental components of verbal spellcasting, serving as activation mechanisms for sorcery. All magic requires visualization and Primus Ignition, Chants and Incantations are thus used to facilitate a sorcerer's visualization, which can then lead to the finalization and stabilization of spell execution.

Incantations are long-form verbal spells, while Chants are shortened, optimized versions of Incantations, reducing casting time at the expense of slightly lowered output. Master sorcerers naturally refine their verbal magic over time, eventually progressing from casting chanted spells at full output to silent spellcasting, where magic is activated purely through mental visualization.

### The Relationship Between Spoken Words & Magic

- A spell and its incantation are the same—speaking a spell into existence gives it form
- For beginners, Incantations are necessary as they help guide their visualization and stabilize Primus
- Advanced sorcerers naturally shorten their Incantations into Chants, reducing casting time
- Master-level sorcerers can cast spells silently, bypassing verbal activation altogether

### The Key Difference: Incantations vs. Chants

|Aspect|Incantation (Full Spell)|Chant (Optimized Spell)|
|---|---|---|
|Length|Full-length verbal spell|Shortened, optimized phrase|
|Casting Time|Slower, requires full recitation|Faster, cutting unnecessary words|
|Power Output|Maximum potential effect|Slightly reduced unless fully mastered|
|Stability|Easier for beginners|Requires stronger visualization|
|Usage|Used by novices and ritual magic|Used by advanced combat sorcerers|
|Final Stage|Evolves into Chants|Evolves into Silent Casting|

### Why Incantations Are Important

- For beginners, Incantations serve as spell stabilizers—without them, a spell may fail or backfire
- They force a sorcerer to focus their visualization, ensuring Primus is shaped correctly
- Even if exhausted, a sorcerer can recite an Incantation to restore a spell's full effectiveness

**Example:** If a sorcerer is drained of energy, their spells naturally weaken. However, by fully reciting an Incantation, they can cast at 100% power, even when exhausted—this functions as an implicit Self-Contract.

### The Function of Chants

- Chants are shortened Incantations, designed for speed
- They allow a sorcerer to cast spells with minimal verbal activation, reducing the chance of an opponent predicting their attack
- However, Chants require strong mental imagery—if the caster fails to visualize the spell correctly, it will either not work or backfire.

### Why Chants Work Like a Verbal Optimization

- Much like shortening code in programming, Chants remove unnecessary verbal commands
- However, a Chant must still evoke the same mental image as the full Incantation
    - Example: Saying “Fireball” instead of “Let the flames ignite and consume my enemies” is only effective if the caster fully visualizes the fireball's shape, size, and effect
- Without proper visualization, Chants will fail to activate—sometimes even harming the caster himself.

### The Implicit Self-Contract in Incantations & Chants

- Reciting an Incantation fully acts as an implicit Self-Contract, reinforcing the spell's effectiveness
- A Chant is a weaker Self-Contract—it reduces casting time, but the sorcerer risks instability if their visualization falters
	- Regardless of the spell's success, sorcerers may experience a slight drop in output with chanted spells.
	- With practice and experience, a sorcerer may regain lost output, enabling them to make maximal use of chanted spells.
- Silent Casting removes the Self-Contract entirely, making it the hardest but most efficient form of magic.
	- At first, a silently casted spell may sharply drop in output or even general effectivity all together
	- Eventually, through practice and experience a sorcerer may be able to cast spells silently at full effect.

### Silent Spellcasting: The Final Stage of Verbal Magic

- Silent casting eliminates the need for spoken words, activating magic purely through visualization
- Beginners cannot start with Silent Casting—it must be trained through Incantations and Chants first
- At first, silent spells are weaker, but with refinement, they can reach full Incantation-level power

## Spell Optimization

Spell Optimization is the systematic enhancement of magic to improve efficiency, speed, power, and stability. While magic in its raw form is unstable, Optimization allows sorcerers to refine spells to function at peak performance.

### What is Spell Optimization?

**The Purpose of Optimization:** Raw magic is inherently unstable and wasteful—it must be controlled and refined for maximum effectiveness. Optimization is the process of modifying a spell to improve aspects like:

- Casting speed (reducing activation time)
- Energy efficiency (lowering the cost of magic)
- Power output (increasing destructive or restorative capabilities)
- Stability (preventing failures and unintended transformations)
- Complexity control (balancing functionality without overcomplicating the spell)

**The Science of Magical Efficiency:**

- Without Optimization, spells consume excessive energy, take too long to cast, or produce unintended effects
- Battra's sorcery is hyper-optimized, meaning he can cast faster, consume less energy, and maintain perfect control
- This level of Optimization allows him to outmatch even powerful opponents with seemingly lesser spells—because he wastes nothing

### The Core Principles of Optimization

**Trade-Offs & Balancing Aspects:** Optimization is not just about making a spell stronger—it is about balance. A sorcerer must decide which aspects to enhance and which to sacrifice.

| Aspect             | Effect of Optimization        | Typical Trade-Offs                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed              | Faster casting time           | May reduce power or stability                      |
| Energy Efficiency  | Lower energy cost             | May require longer casting time or reduced output  |
| Power Output       | Increased spell effectiveness | Higher energy consumption or a rise in instability |
| Stability          | Reduces chance of failure     | Can make the spell slower or weaker                |
| Complexity Control | Balances multiple effects     | Can limit the spell's raw output                   |

**The Limits and Peak of Optimization:**

- Sorcerers must always sacrifice something when optimizing a spell, even Battra. As such, creativity and situational awareness is key to choosing what to trade off.
- Battra's obsession with Optimization gave him the capacity to control magic so efficiently that his spells cost negligible energy, allowing him to generate more energy than he can consume, even in the midst of battle. 

### Traditional vs. Commitment-Based Optimization

There are two primary methods of Optimization:

**A. Traditional Optimization:**

- A slow, scientific refinement of magic through experimentation
- Requires years of testing, adjusting, and perfecting
- No negative drawbacks, but time-consuming
- Most civilizations practice Traditional Optimization, often inefficiently

**B. Commitment-Based Optimization:**

- Uses Commitments (Vows, Contracts, Covenants) to enforce rules on magic
- Instantly refines a spell, allowing for near-perfect efficiency
- Risky—if the Commitment is broken, the magic could fail or backfire
- Battra's primary method of Optimization; he introduces, then eventually teaches this to his students first rather than *TradOpt*
	- Primary Commitment of choice is the Contract, specifically the Self-Contract.

**Example of a Commitment-Based Optimization:** Instead of optimizing a fireball spell over years, a sorcerer creates a Contract: “This fireball will always form in 0.5 seconds, but I will never be able to use another projectile spell.” 

### The Role of Chants & Incantations in Optimization

**Incantations as Spell Activation:**

- A spell and its incantation are one and the same—the words bring the magic into existence
- Beginners require long incantations to stabilize their magic
- Advanced sorcerers shorten them naturally, as they refine their visualization

**Chants as Optimized Incantations:**

- Chants are shortened versions of incantations, designed to cut unnecessary words
- They allow for faster casting, but visualization must be precise—otherwise, the spell may fail
- Battra teaches sorcerers to develop their own chants, as pre-made spells are often inefficient

**Silent Spellcasting: The Ultimate Verbal Optimization:**

- Silent casting eliminates verbal activation entirely
- Requires perfect mastery of visualization
- Silent spells are often weaker at first, but with practice, they reach full power
- Battra can silent-cast at full power, giving him instant spell execution without any drawbacks

### Written Magic as a Form of Permanent Optimization

**How Written Magic Enhances Spells:**

- Written spells function as “pre-loaded” Optimized spells
- Unlike spoken spells, written magic stores all Optimizations within the inscription
- This allows for:
    - Permanent enchantments
    - Stored spells for later activation
    - Spell formulas that can be studied, modified, and improved

**Shortening Inscriptions for Maximum Efficiency:**

- Just like Chants, written spells can be optimized by reducing unnecessary symbols
- However, clarity is critical—shortening a spell too much may cause misfires
- Battra engraves Optimized spells onto his wings, allowing for instant access to pre-refined magic

## Spellcasting Paradigms

In this system, spellcasting is not a singular method, but a collection of structured paradigms that define how magic is cast, optimized, and executed. These paradigms influence the way a sorcerer designs, organizes, and deploys spells, much like programming paradigms in software development.

Each paradigm has its own unique advantages, limitations, and interactions with Commitments, Spell Optimization, and Techniques. Mastering multiple paradigms allows for greater flexibility and efficiency in combat and magical study.

### 1. Procedural Magic (Sequential Spell Execution)

- Spells follow a predefined, step-by-step process, ensuring stability and reliability
- Each step must be completed in order, making this the most structured form of spellcasting
- Highly effective for ritual magic, precise enchantments, and large-scale spell formations
- Weakness: Slower than other paradigms, and rigid once initiated

Best suited for: Ritual magic, precise calculations, grand-scale spells.

Example: A sorcerer casting a multi-step barrier spell must complete each stage of the ritual before the barrier takes full effect.

### 2. Object-Oriented Magic (Techniques as Encapsulated Spell Frameworks)

- Techniques function as structured spell systems, encapsulating related spells into a single framework
- A Technique acts as a class, with its spells functioning as methods that can be called upon
- Inheritance exists—Techniques can be passed down through lineage or learned through mastery
- Commitments can apply to the entire Technique or specific spells within it

Best suited for: Sorcerers who specialize in a particular style of magic, inherited family Techniques, long-term spell development.

Example: A fire sorcerer's “Phoenix's Path” Technique may contain spells for fire manipulation, combustion control, and heat absorption, all under a unified system.

### 3. Declarative Magic (High-Level Spell Design)

- Instead of defining every step, the sorcerer sets the intent and constraints of the spell, allowing magic to handle execution
- Focuses on what the spell should do rather than how it should be done
- Can lead to highly optimized magic but requires mastery over visualization and Primus control
- Weakness: Less control over precise mechanics, relies on magic's ability to interpret intent

Best suited for: Efficient large-scale magic, high-speed combat sorcery, and intuitive casters.

Example: A sorcerer commands “Create a barrier that blocks all attacks for 10 seconds”, and the spell forms automatically without requiring precise structuring.

### 4. Event-Driven Magic (Triggered Spells)

- Spells activate in response to predefined conditions, requiring no direct action from the caster at the moment of execution
- Trigger types include: condition-based, proximity-based, time-based, action-based, and command-based activation
- Allows for automated defensive systems, counterattacks, and environmental traps
- Weakness: Less flexible once the trigger is set, can be predicted and countered if discovered

Best suited for: Sorcerers who rely on preparation, defensive combatants, and strategists.

Example: A sorcerer places a “Delayed Ice Spear” spell that activates when an enemy steps into a certain area.

### 5. Reactive Magic (Self-Adaptive Spells)

- Spells continuously adjust their behavior based on real-time input from the environment, enemy actions, or the caster's energy levels
- Highly versatile, capable of responding dynamically to changing combat conditions
- Categories include energy-based adaptation, enemy-responsive adaptation, environmental adaptation, and tactical adaptation
- Weakness: Requires high-level magical knowledge, may not always make optimal decisions

Best suited for: Master sorcerers, high-level combatants, and intelligent spell designers.

Example: A “Living Lightning” spell shifts its trajectory in real-time based on enemy movements.

### 6. Functional Magic (Spell Composition & Layering)

- Spells can be combined, stacked, and modified to create layered effects
- Encourages spell chaining, concurrent casting, and multi-tiered execution strategies
- Highly efficient when combined with Techniques and Commitments for enhanced synergy
- Weakness: Complex to execute, requires immense visualization skill

Best suited for: Advanced spellcasters who maximize efficiency and adaptability in combat.

Example: A “Triple Cast” spell sequence layers a fire attack, an explosion spell, and a gravity effect, all activating in rapid succession.

### 7. Parallel Magic (Multi-Threaded Spellcasting)

- Allows a sorcerer to cast multiple spells simultaneously, treating them as independent processes
- Highly useful for complex combat sequences, large-scale spell formations, and high-speed engagements
- Requires extreme mental discipline and energy management to sustain
- Weakness: The more spells cast in parallel, the greater the strain on the caster

Best suited for: Grandmasters of spellcasting, elite combat sorcerers, large-scale warfare.

Example: A master ice sorcerer casting “Ice Wall,” “Glacier Spear,” and “Blizzard” at the same time, each spell operating independently.

### 8. Concurrent Magic (Interdependent Spellcasting)

- Unlike Parallel Magic, Concurrent Magic spells are linked together and interact dynamically
- Spells do not function independently but rather as a cohesive system with interwoven dependencies
- Can result in highly complex spell effects, as one spell's success affects the others
- Weakness: If one spell in the sequence is disrupted, the entire structure may collapse

Best suited for: High-level tacticians, expert spellweavers, ritual casters.

Example: A spell sequence where “Flame Arc” ignites “Inferno Strike,” which then fuels “Magma Surge.”

### 9. Chained Magic (Progressive Spellcasting)

- A sequence of spells executed in rapid succession, building upon the effects of previous spells
- Requires strong forward-thinking and planning from the caster
- The strength of later spells may be dependent on the success of earlier ones
- Weakness: Interruptions can break the chain, making the strategy high-risk, high-reward

Best suited for: Combat specialists, duelists, long-combo casters.

Example: A fire sorcerer casts “Ignition” → “Flame Lance” → “Explosion Surge,” each spell enhancing the next.

## Spell Keeping

Spell keeping is the structured discipline of storing, categorizing, and retrieving spells in a way that enhances efficiency, accessibility, and usability. While most sorcerers rely on memorization, scrolls, or grimoires, Battra has perfected Spellkeeping to an unparalleled level, utilizing Pocket Universes, mental indexing, and psychic retrieval methods to maintain the most advanced magical archive in existence.

### What is Spellkeeping?

Spellkeeping is the art of managing a sorcerer's spell library, ensuring they can retrieve spells quickly and efficiently without wasted effort.

**The Core Principles of Spellkeeping:**

- Storage → Spells must be kept in an accessible, secure location
- Categorization → Spells should be organized logically for instant recall
- Optimization → The method of storing and retrieving spells should be as efficient as possible
- Retrieval → Spells must be immediately accessible when needed

**Why Spellkeeping is Important:**

- Prevents spell loss or degradation over time
- Reduces casting delays—spells can be retrieved instantly rather than recalled manually
- Allows for large-scale magical knowledge retention—no need to memorize everything
- Ensures a sorcerer can adapt quickly, selecting the right spell at the right moment

### Battra's Mastery of Spellkeeping

Battra has developed the most advanced Spellkeeping system in existence, utilizing Pocket Universes, psychic indexing, and a fully structured retrieval system.

**The Tree of Magic: The Core of His Spellkeeping System:**

- At the heart of Battra's storage method is a massive tree inside one of his Pocket Universes
- Branches represent schools of magic, while each leaf or fruit represents a specific spell
- Battra can pluck spells directly or use his mental interface to retrieve them remotely

**Spell Storage Process:**

- A spell is categorized and linked to a specific branch
- Its location is stored within Battra's mental archive
- When needed, a retrieval system fetches the spell

**Retrieving Spells: The Interface System:**

- Instead of physically retrieving spells from the tree, Battra uses an optimized interface system
- Spells are stored as “orbs” in a secondary pocket universe
- These orbs act as keys that fetch the corresponding spell from the tree
- Upon touching an orb, a script retrieves the spell instantly, transferring it to his mind
- This system functions like a hash map, ensuring perfect organization and instant retrieval

**Advantages of This System:**

- Prevents memory overload—Battra doesn't need to recall every spell manually
- Instant retrieval—he can access spells far faster than any other sorcerer
- Self-correcting—glitches caused by Primus' unstable nature are automatically resolved

**Physical Storage: Wing Inscriptions & External Spell Libraries:**

- Battra's wings function as a living spell grimoire, allowing him to store spells directly onto his body
- His shed larval skin once served as an external archive, though he later refined this method
- He now uses Pocket Universes as external spell libraries, ensuring that he is never without access to his full magical arsenal

### Advanced Spellkeeping Techniques

Battra has perfected multiple layers of Spellkeeping, making his system the most advanced in the universe.

**Multi-Tiered Spell Storage:** Battra categorizes spells into multiple levels of storage, ensuring the best spells are instantly accessible.

|Tier|Function|
|---|---|
|Primary Wing Inscriptions|His most frequently used spells, immediately available|
|Mental Indexing (Psychic)|Mid-level spells, stored for rapid retrieval|
|Pocket Universes (The Tree of Magic)|Massive spell archive, accessible via retrieval scripts|
|External Libraries (Stored in Keep Charlie)|Knowledge archives, used for long-term preservation|

**How Battra Modifies Stored Spells:**

- Battra's interface is read-only, meaning to modify a spell, he must retrieve it manually
- He can remove outdated spells, refine them, or replace them entirely
- He is currently looking for a way to automate modifications, but he enjoys manually refining spells

### Security & Protection of Stored Spells

Since Battra's spell archive contains thousands of powerful techniques, security is extremely tight.

**Defense Mechanisms of His Spell Keeping System:**

- Unauthorized access is impossible—only Battra can retrieve spells from his pocket universes
- If he does not use the archive for a long time, he forgets the entrance, preventing outside interference
- His archives are encrypted, meaning even if someone broke in, they wouldn't be able to understand or use the spells stored there
- Physical inscriptions can be erased, but they are protected by layered security spells

## Raw Primus Manipulation

Raw Primus Manipulation refers to directly wielding Primus in its pure, untransformed state, without first converting it into a structured magical energy type (such as elemental, spiritual, or bound energy). Primus is naturally unstable, meaning that when a sorcerer attempts to manipulate it in its raw form, it actively resists control, leading to unpredictable or catastrophic results for most casters.

Battra is the only known sorcerer capable of wielding Raw Primus due to his perfect control and efficiency, making this one of his most defining abilities. However, even he considers it a last-resort technique, as his godlike control and efficiency is the baseline and it carries extreme risks due to its instability.

### What is Raw Primus?

- Primus is the fundamental force behind all magic, but in its raw state, it is untamed, chaotic, and constantly shifting
- All magic is simply a controlled transformation of Primus into something structured (fire, barriers, curses, enchantments, etc.)
- Raw Primus is magic before it takes form—it is magic without a rule set, without definition, and without limits
- Normally, Primus transforms upon contact with a sorcerer's soul, making it impossible to wield directly—except for Battra

### The Nature of Raw Primus Manipulation

Raw Primus does not function like structured magic. It does not follow a predefined system of elemental manipulation, spellcasting laws, or typical energy mechanics. Instead, it has several unique properties:

**The Three Primary Traits of Raw Primus:**

- It resists structure → Unlike regular magic, Raw Primus refuses to remain in a fixed state
- It has undefined behavior → The same spell cast with Raw Primus may have different effects each time
- It ignores standard magical rules → Since Raw Primus has no inherent form, it bypasses conventional magical mechanics

The result? Raw Primus Spells are instant, cost no energy, and have no travel time—but they are inherently unstable.

### The Advantages & Disadvantages of Raw Primus Manipulation

**Advantages (Why It's So Powerful)**

|Advantage|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Zero Cast Time|The spell takes effect instantly—there is no activation delay|
|Zero Energy Cost|No mana or stamina is consumed, as Primus is used in its natural state|
|Zero Travel Time|The spell does not need to “move” to its target—it simply occurs|
|Ignores Conventional Spell Defenses|Standard magical resistances do not apply, as the spell is not technically an “attack”|

Example: If Battra were to cast a Raw Primus-based fire spell, instead of launching a fireball, the target would immediately combust—as if fire had always existed at that location.

**Disadvantages (Why It's Dangerous)**

|Disadvantage|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Unstable & Unpredictable|The same spell may produce different results each time it is cast|
|Difficult to Control|Raw Primus constantly shifts, requiring extreme precision|
|Backfires Easily|Any lapse in concentration may cause unintended effects|
|Reality Rejection|Some locations or beings may resist Raw Primus spells simply because they defy natural laws|

Example: If Battra attempts to heal someone with Raw Primus, the result may be instant regeneration, catastrophic mutation, or nothing at all.

### The Only Stable Raw Primus Spell: Twin Cutters

Most Raw Primus Spells are unusable due to their instability, but Battra has one exception—Twin Cutters.

**How Twin Cutters Works:**

- The spell was originally a generic “cut anything” spell, but it had severe limitations on what it could cut
- By reinforcing it with a Commitment, Battra refined it into two distinct versions:
    - One cuts anything except people
    - One cuts only people, but nothing else
- The restriction stabilized the spell, allowing it to be used reliably

Twin Cutters is the only known example of a Raw Primus Spell that has been permanently stabilized.

### Battra's Perspective on Raw Primus Manipulation

Despite being the only being capable of wielding Raw Primus, Battra rarely uses it. He views it as a last-resort technique, only useful in situations where no other magic can be relied upon.

- He prefers structured magic, as it is far more reliable and efficient
- He recognizes that Raw Primus carries too much risk, even for him
- He believes that no amount of optimization can fully stabilize Raw Primus, which is why he only develops specific spells from it instead of using it freely

Battra does not see Raw Primus Manipulation as a power boost, but as a dangerous tool that should only be used when absolutely necessary.

### The Forbidden Archive: Where Raw Primus Spells Are Stored

Battra has created dozens of experimental Raw Primus Spells, but due to their extreme instability, he does not use them. Instead, he stores them in his Forbidden Archive, accessible only by him.

- Most of these spells are untested or failed experiments, meaning they could be even more dangerous than he realizes
- Many of them have undefined behaviors, meaning Battra himself does not fully know what they do
- He actively studies them in hopes of stabilizing them, but progress is slow due to their unpredictable nature

If any of these spells were to be used recklessly, they could potentially collapse reality in the affected area.

### The Cosmic Perspective on Raw Primus Manipulation

**Why No Other Sorcerer Uses It:**

- All other sorcerers struggle to stabilize Primus, even in its transformed state
- Wielding it in its rawest form requires precision that no one but Battra possesses
- Many civilizations have legends of Raw Primus Magic, but they dismiss it as myth because it is impossible for them to control

**If Another Sorcerer Attempted to Use Raw Primus…**

|Skill Level|Result of Using Raw Primus|
|---|---|
|Novice|Instantaneous death or catastrophic spell failure|
|Experienced Sorcerer|Complete loss of control, backfire effects|
|Master Sorcerer|May successfully cast a spell but will suffer unintended side effects|
|Battra|The only being who can wield Raw Primus predictably, though even he considers it risky|

This explains why Raw Primus Manipulation is not widespread—it is simply beyond the ability of all but one sorcerer.

## Written Magic

Written Magic is a form of spellcasting that involves inscribing magical formulas onto physical or metaphysical surfaces. Unlike verbal magic, which requires active casting, Written Magic allows for permanent enchantments, stored spells, and automated magical effects that persist without the caster's continued attention.

### Fundamentals of Written Magic

**Definition and Purpose:**

- Written Magic involves transcribing spells into physical form through special inks, carvings, or energy patterns
- It allows magic to exist independently of the caster once activated
- Functions as both storage and execution medium for spells
- Creates permanent or semi-permanent magical effects

**Advantages over Verbal Magic:**

- Persistence: Effects remain active without the caster's presence
- Precision: Allows for extremely detailed spell construction
- Stability: Less prone to miscast than verbal spells
- Storage: Preserves complex spells exactly as designed
- Automation: Can be triggered by specific conditions

**Disadvantages compared to Verbal Magic:**

- Less adaptable once created
- Requires physical components (special inks, surfaces, etc.)
- Can be tampered with or destroyed
- Typically requires longer initial creation time
- More difficult to modify on the fly

### The Components of Written Magic

**Magical Inscriptions:**

- The physical representation of a spell in written form
- Can include symbols, runes, diagrams, formulas, and circuits
- The precision and quality of inscriptions directly affect spell stability

**Magical Inks and Materials:**

- Special preparations infused with magical properties
- Often include components like rare minerals, plant extracts, or creature essences
- The quality of materials influences the power and longevity of the spell

**Activation Mechanisms:**

- Determine how and when a written spell activates
- Types include:
    - Touch activation (physical contact)
    - Command activation (verbal trigger)
    - Condition activation (responds to specific circumstances)
    - Passive activation (constantly active)

### Battra's Use of Written Magic

As a Divine Moth with originally limited magic capabilities, Battra developed extensive proficiency with Written Magic to compensate for these limitations:

**Wing Inscriptions:**

- Battra inscribes spells directly onto his wings using magical patterns
- In his Titan form, these inscriptions allow him to cast magic despite species limitations
- In human form, he maintains a metaphysical version of these inscriptions
- Serves as a constantly available spell repository for his most frequently used magic

**Evolution of His Written Magic System:**

- Initially used crude patterns with limited effect
- Gradually refined his system through observation and experimentation
- Eventually developed unique shorthand notation for maximum efficiency
- Created a hybrid system combining Written and Psychic magic elements

**Optimization Techniques:**

- Reducing unnecessary symbols while maintaining spell integrity
- Creating nested spell structures where one inscription triggers multiple effects
- Implementing self-maintaining circuits that repair minor damage
- Developing resonance between related inscriptions to amplify effects

### Applications of Written Magic

**Enchantment:**

- Permanent or semi-permanent magical effects imbued into objects
- Examples: Weapons that never dull, clothing that adapts to temperature, items that glow in darkness
- Typically requires repeated application of the same inscription to “set” the magic

**Wards and Barriers:**

- Protective inscriptions that repel specific threats or entities
- Often arranged in geometric patterns to cover an area
- Can be layered for multiple protections
- Monarch facilities use Battra-designed wards extensively

**Spell Storage:**

- Inscriptions that contain complete spells ready for activation
- Function like “magical batteries” storing power until needed
- Examples include scrolls, talismans, and spell cards
- Keep Charlie archives thousands of such stored spells

**Magical Automation:**

- Self-executing magical systems that perform functions without oversight
- Used extensively in Keep Charlie's security systems
- Can monitor conditions and respond accordingly
- The Portcullis Mystic uses complex Written Magic automation

### Written Magic in Combat

**Tactical Applications:**

- Pre-inscribed battle spells for instant deployment
- Trap-laying through hidden inscriptions
- Protective sigils to counter specific enemy abilities
- Quick-cast systems using abbreviated inscriptions

**Battra's Combat Written Magic:**

- Can instantly activate wing inscriptions during battle
- Uses a system of layered, conditional triggers
- Maintains multiple backup spells ready for activation
- Can modify inscriptions mid-combat for adaptive response

**Limitations:**

- Requires preparation time
- Physical inscriptions can be damaged or destroyed
- Environmental factors may interfere with complex inscriptions
- Most effective when tailored to anticipated threats

## The Soul & Magic

The soul is a fundamental and immutable concept in this magical system, serving as both the anchor and catalyst for magical effects. Its relationship with magic defines how spells are cast, how commitments function, and how magical energy is structured.

### Core Properties of the Soul

- **Immutability:** The soul is inviolable, eternal, and cannot be fundamentally altered
- **Identity:** It is the seat of a being's true identity and essence
- **Primus Stabilizer:** Acts as the stabilizer of magic, reinforcing Primus when shaped into spells or Commitments
- **Magical Interface:** Sorcery interacts with Primus through the soul, ensuring controlled magical transformation
- **Commitment Anchor:** Breaking certain Commitments (like Vows or Oaths) affects the soul, leading to permanent consequences

### The Soul & Antitheriomorphosis

Antitheriomorphosis permanently transformed Titans into humans, yet it did not alter their souls—they retain all their abilities and instincts, even if their physical bodies changed.

**The Soul's Inviolability in Transformation:**

- Titans' souls remained unchanged despite their bodies becoming human
- This suggests Antitheriomorphosis does not target the soul—it is purely a bodily phenomenon that forcibly reshaped Primus interaction at the biological level
- Battra was immune because his mastery of magic prevented the transformation—suggesting the process acts externally rather than rewriting the soul itself

### The Soul & Commitments

Commitments can interact with the soul's ability to stabilize Primus—but they don't change its core identity unless taken to extreme levels (Oaths, Vows, Covenants).

**Relationship Levels:**

- Contracts, Promises, and Oaths do not alter the soul itself, but they can affect a sorcerer's ability to channel magic through Primus
- Vows bind directly to the soul—breaking them permanently will end in death, often through unpredictable means
- Covenants override the soul's autonomy, enforcing absolute, divine-level commitments

### The Soul & Primus

Primus transforms upon contact with a sorcerer's soul, becoming a structured magical force. This suggests that every individual interacts with Primus differently based on their soul's nature.

**Soul Signatures:**

- A soul's unique “signature” determines how it interacts with Primus
- This explains why some sorcerers develop unique magic styles despite having access to the same techniques
- Godzilla & Mothra's Vow is absolute despite possessing no magical aptitude because their souls are incredibly powerful, creating an unbreakable reinforcement effect

### Null Species and the Soul

Some species, like _Titanus Gojira_, are classified as “Null,” meaning they cannot naturally perceive or interact with Primus. However, this limitation doesn't mean their souls are weaker—in fact, the opposite is often true.

**Characteristics of Null Souls:**

- Cannot naturally perceive or manipulate Primus
- Often possess extraordinarily strong souls that manifest power in non-magical ways
- Can still participate in Commitments, sometimes with even stronger effects than magical beings
- A Null's Promise can sometimes generate magical effects through sheer force of will

## The Divine Mandate Against Sorcery

### Historical Context

Long ago in the Golden Age of Atlantis, human sorcery and technology flourished under the protection of Godzilla and the tutelage of Battra. Atlantis stood as the pinnacle of human achievement, while other human tribes and nations like the Eclipse (guided by Mothra) developed their own magical traditions.

During this era, a nameless human tribe (taught by Battra) began researching the nature of the soul. Despite warnings from both Atlantis and the Eclipse, this tribe discovered forbidden methods to modify souls—both their own and others'. They began experimenting on the people of the Eclipse, capturing their souls, imprisoning them, and even destroying some completely—an act previously thought impossible.

### The Heavenly Intervention

Witnessing this abomination, the Heavens declared “enough.” Mothra, possessed by the Heavenly Instance and driven by grief over her lost human friends, enacted divine judgment:

1. She annihilated the offending tribe completely, erasing them from existence and memory
2. She decreed a Divine Mandate that disabled humanity's perception of Primus, forcibly turning all humans into Null beings
3. She exiled her brother Battra from Earth, blaming him for the tragedy

### The Consequences

**For Humanity:**

- The loss of magical perception led to the collapse of magical civilizations, including Atlantis
- Sorcery became impossible for humans, vanishing into myth and legend
- Without magic supporting their advanced technology, Atlantean cities sank beneath the oceans

**For Battra:**

- Exiled from Earth and unable to even perceive it
- Forced to wander the stars for eons
- Developed bitterness toward his sister for what he perceived as an unjust punishment

**For Mothra:**

- Despite the tragedy, she maintained her optimistic view of humanity
- Placed all blame on her brother rather than humanity itself
- Continued to serve as Earth's divine guardian

### The Return of Human Magic

The Divine Mandate remained in effect for hundreds of thousands of years until relatively recently when Mothra chose to lift it. This occurred following the Xillien Invasion, allowing humans to once again perceive and manipulate Primus.

**Conditions Leading to Lifting the Mandate:**

- The Divine Mandate required active enforcement by Mothra as the Divine Instance
- During a period where Mothra was disconnected from her divine powers, her enforcement of the Mandate temporarily ceased
- This created a window where Battra could finally locate Earth after eons of being unable to perceive it
- When Mothra's power returned, she did not actively reinforce the Mandate, allowing human magic to persist

**Modern Consequences:**

- Humans are rediscovering magical abilities after millennia without them
- Keep Charlie was established by Battra to train new human sorcerers
- Magical knowledge must be rebuilt from scratch, as most ancient techniques were lost
