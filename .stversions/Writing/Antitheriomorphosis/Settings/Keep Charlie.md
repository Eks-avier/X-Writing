# Keep Charlie

Keep Charlie (also known as “the Keep”) is a mystical educational facility housed within [[Castle Bravo]], established by [[Battra, the Lord of the Mystic Arts|Battra]] following the [[Xillien Invasion]]. It serves as Earth's first and only institution dedicated to teaching [[Sorcery]] and [[Psionic]] development.

## Overview

The Keep exists in a separate dimensional space, making it invisible from Castle Bravo's exterior. It contains 11 specialized sections:

- 5 sections for mystic arts training
- 3 sections for psychic abilities development
- 2 sections for junior students
- 2 separate lounging areas for Sorcery and Psionic students

## Common Area

At the heart of Keep Charlie lies a central common area designed to foster interaction and camaraderie between both divisions. This space features modern amenities including:

- Gaming consoles
- Dedicated computer stations with customized PC setups
- An automated kitchen facility

The kitchen, while unmanned, maintains a constant supply of food and beverages through an automated system. [[Service Robots]] travel between the main Castle Bravo kitchen and the Keep's kitchen via designated portals, ensuring continuous restocking and service.

## Architecture

Keep Charlie's design draws heavily from medieval architecture, particularly castle keeps and fortifications. Despite its traditional exterior, the interior features modern amenities and specialized training facilities. The structure exists within a pocket universe, formerly one of Battra's personal dimensional spaces, which he sacrificed to create the facility.

The Keep is accessible only through the [[Wall Walk]], which serves as its anchor to reality. If either the Wall Walk or Castle Bravo is destroyed, Keep Charlie becomes completely inaccessible. The facility's medieval-inspired architecture extends to its security system, the [[Portcullis Mystic]], a mystically enhanced version of a traditional castle portcullis.

## Security and Defense Systems

Keep Charlie employs multiple layers of security in order to ensure student safety.

### Primary Defense

The Portcullis Mystic serves as the primary gateway, granting access exclusively to:

- Students
- High-ranking [[Titans]]
- Senior [[Monarch]] personnel
- [[Keepass]] holders

Unauthorized individuals attempting initial access face lethal consequences, as the Wall Walk is designed to disappear beneath trespassers who linger for more than five minutes.

### Secondary Defenses

If intruders manage to breach the Portcullis Mystic, several backup systems activate:

- Service robots possess banishment capabilities against unauthorized individuals
- Surveillance cameras throughout the Keep track intruder movements
- Automated trap systems triggered by camera detection

### Emergency Protocol

As a last resort, the Keep can become intangible. This defense mechanism affects everyone within the Keep except:

- Students (automatically whitelisted since the Keep's construction or upon enrollment)
- Titans
- Senior Monarch personnel who have consumed [[The Eavesdropper]]

This emergency system serves as an absolute failsafe against persistent intrusion.

## History

Following his subjugation by the [[Writing/Antitheriomorphosis/Characters/Godzilla/Godzilla, the King of the Monsters]] and [[Mothra, the Queen of the Monsters]], Battra was ordered to assist Monarch, leading to Castle Bravo's transformation into a mobile fortress. When Mothra lifted the [[Divine Mandate]]—which had prevented humans from accessing sorcery—Battra established the Keep to train emerging sorcerers.

The facility's creation was precipitated by the appearance of three young sorcerers and [[Miki Saegusa]], humanity's first natural psychic in millennia. To accommodate these students without disrupting Castle Bravo's scientific operations, Battra sacrificed one of his pocket universes to create Keep Charlie.

## Current Status

Keep Charlie continues to serve as Earth's primary supernatural learning facility, accommodating an increasing student population across both divisions. The facility's mystical nature allows for unlimited expansion, with Battra planning additional facilities for the Psionic department.
