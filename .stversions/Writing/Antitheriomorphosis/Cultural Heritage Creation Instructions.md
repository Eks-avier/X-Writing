# Godzilla Cultural Heritage Files: Creation Instructions

## Overview

These instructions guide the creation of three atomic model files documenting Godzilla's cultural heritage in the Antitheriomorphosis universe. Following the hub-and-spoke architecture, these files will document the species, cultural, and personal aspects of Godzilla's heritage while maintaining consistency and eliminating contradictions.

## General Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Use rich, atmospheric descriptions that convey weight and significance
- Balance factual information with emotional resonance
- Include occasional quotes or perspective shifts for emphasis
- Employ sensory details to make the ancient culture feel tangible
- Use measured, deliberate language that mirrors Godzilla's own character

### Tag Structure
- Species classification: `atm/species/classification/[rank]`
- Species names: `atm/species/[species_name]`
- Cultural entities: `atm/culture/[culture_name]`
- Individual titans: `atm/titans/[name]` and `atm/titans/[name]/[aspect]`

### Cross-Referencing
- Implement rich interlinking between all three documents
- Link to other relevant character aspects (Physical Appearance, Psychological Profile)
- Use consistent terminology and concepts across all documents
- Include callout boxes to highlight connections between documents

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the files in sequence:
   - Start with Titanus-Gojira-Species.md (broadest scope)
   - Then create Northern-Gojira-Culture.md (factional scope)
   - Finally create Godzilla-Cultural-Heritage.md (individual scope)

2. For each file:
   - Implement the YAML frontmatter exactly as specified
   - Create all required sections with rich, descriptive content
   - Address contradictions listed for that specific file
   - Ensure proper cross-referencing to related documents
   - Use callout boxes for important connections or notes
   - Maintain the atmospheric, weighty tone appropriate for the content

3. After creating all three files:
   - Review for consistency across the documents
   - Ensure terminology remains consistent
   - Verify all cross-references are correctly implemented
   - Check that contradictions have been properly resolved

## Style Examples

### Species Description Example:
> The *Titanus gojira* emerged from Earth's primordial oceans as living dynamos—beings of extraordinary power whose very cells converted radiation into usable energy with an efficiency no other species has matched. Their distinctive dorsal fins, evolving from simple thermal regulators into sophisticated energy collection systems, became the most recognizable silhouette in Earth's ancient skies and waters, a shape that triggered instinctive deference in lesser beings. These creatures did not merely adapt to their environment; they reshaped it, leaving geological formations and radiation patterns that would persist for millions of years.

### Cultural Description Example:
> Northern *Titanus gojira* moved through their icy domains with deliberate economy, their white-tinged dorsal fins occasionally catching the aurora's light like living reflections of the polar sky. Their family units functioned as seamless organisms—parents and offspring connected through complex energy patterns that communicated more in a moment than vocalization could express in hours. When a Northern family claimed territory, they did so not through ostentatious displays but through the quiet certainty of their presence, a gravitational weight that altered the behavior of all creatures within their domain.

### Personal Heritage Example:
> Godzilla carries his Northern heritage not as a banner but as bedrock—fundamental, unseen, yet supporting everything above. His movements in human form retain the deliberate economy of Northern energy conservation, each gesture purposeful and contained. When truly relaxed, his eyes shift to the rare golden hue inherited from his mother, a genetic gift seen in less than two percent of Northern *Titanus gojira*. Though his cultural knowledge remains incomplete—focused primarily on the survival skills Dagon prioritized during their compressed time together—the essence of Northern values shapes his every decision: family before faction, faction before species, and the mysterious Directive of Heaven above all.
