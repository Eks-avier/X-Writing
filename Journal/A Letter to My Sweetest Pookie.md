Hi, Daniel! 

If you're reading this letter, I have died due to lung cancer and heartbreak, please proceed to this following address to visit my grave: 

Anyway, as Christmas inches closer, I'm once again reminded just how grateful I am for having met you. You changed me, for the good. I realized that I could actually fall in love, and I'm glad I fell in love with you.

You've got the most beautiful eyes, the goofiest smile, the juiciest.... and that back... Yeah, mhm, delicious. But beyond your physical features, which I find utterly handsome, you've got the gentlest heart. 

I didn't expect that we'd be talking for an entire year. All the people I have talked to at Romeo or some other sites? Sometimes they don't even last hours... You however? We're still talking. In fact, I haven't talked to any of the friends I made abroad for this long... 

I don't know why you still keep talking to me, to be honest. What do I give to you anyway besides being annoying and clingy? And yet, for some reason, you still keep talking to me. Have I really touched your life as deeply as you did mine? Or am I just deluded? Be honest for me for a sec, do you actually love me? Because if you do love me: I promise you Daniel, thousands of kilometers of distance will not be enough to stop me from loving you back. But if you don't... I guess I can say I tried, right? 

You're honestly so fucking goofy. Goodness, I think I can just sit down and watch you be your goofy self. Imagine me in your bed just sitting down and watching you do... well, whatever haha. God, why are you so cute Daniel? I was intrigued by the size of your cock, but it turns out I fell in love with the size of your heart and kindness. I truly don't deserve you...

For this Christmas, I hope you have lots of gifts. You probably don't think you need that, but I still wish you get many gifts! You deserve to be loved, and I am a bit jealous that the people around you can show you that personally while I'm just stuck here... It's really unfair.

This letter probably sounds depressing now. Sorry about that! But you just really make me so so so so happy that it makes me sad. Is there a word for German in that, you fine German man? 

To end on a happy note: I love you... Ich liebe dich... Je t'aime beaucoup... Mahal kita. I don't know what else to say, damn it HAHAHAHAHA. What are you doing to me? Usually I can find all the words to say, but you just leave me speechless. Whether you're being silly, mean, sweet, or honest. I love you **everything** about you, Daniel. Du bedeutest mir alles. 

You really weren't lying that you are my Christmas gift , aren't you? ðŸ¤­.

Anyway, Merry Christmas my Daniel! Du bist mein schÃ¶nstes Weihnachtsgeschenk! ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜˜

Tell me, what do you think of our relationship this year? Show me your thoughts. Don't be shy to yap to me every once in a while ðŸ¤£...

That's all, my love! Again, Merry Christmas AND I LOOOOOOVE YOUUUUUU. The best Christmas gift ever would be me being your boyfriend... ðŸ¥¹
