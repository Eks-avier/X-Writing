# On Godzilla

My actual first exposure to Godzilla was from a bunch of plastic dinosaur toys they sell in a plastic tube for a dollar or two. Bundled there was some weird green dinosaur that had, what I called, vegetables on his back. One day, I brought it with me, and my dad told me it was called “Godzilla”. Funny thing was that we were in a Japanese restaurant that time. Looks like I was fated, eh?

In November 15, 2009, I had my first ACTUAL Godzilla action figure. It was a Godzilla from Godzilla: Final Wars. By that time, I never stopped bringing that weird dinosaur with vegetables on his back. Man, when I saw the guy himself on a Toys R' Us shelf, I was a loss for words LMAO. My parents ended up buying it for me, and the rest was history. It went on so many adventures with me LOOOL. Field trips, other regions in my country, always my first pick when playing toys, etc. I also remember being so dismayed that I could never watch the latest Godzilla movie during that time, which was Godzilla: Final Wars. It was released in 2004.

In the meantime, I've consumed fanfictions in various sites: Wattpad, Fanfiction.net, Quotev, you name it.

And in the infancy of YouTube, I watched several AMVs, a buttload of video skit series with action figures much like mine, video game play-throughs on the Wii, GameCube or PS2. When that didn't work, I watched various toy reviews of the other figures I couldn't buy. I remember being so jealous. My dad once caught me searching for them in Ebay and Amazon and told me that those are paid in dollars. I was so sad when I realized…

So, those were my way of consuming the Godzilla franchise; I didn't know of any way to watch the movies, so that's all I could do for now.

Then, when I first heard that a NEW Godzilla movie in 2014, boy did I jump for joy—literally. I remember seeing the news on my uncle's 12 inch laptop LOLOLOL. My grandma scolded me for jumping too much since she could hear the commotion from the ground floor.

For about a year or two since I heard the existence of the movie, I followed it, OBSESSED about it. I remember going to sites like syfy.net where they had a countdown to the movie and checking it everyday before going to school at 12:30 PM or after coming home to school at 5:30 PM

Then, the comic-con teaser dropped. HOLY FUCK I COULD ACTUALLY CRY. I think I sat on my uncle's desk for a good 5 minutes just taking it in. Oppenheimer's narration of Bhagavad Gita in the background, apocalyptic scenery, then MY MAN'S ROAR AT THE END???? THAT SILHOUETTE???GOOSEBUMPS. Over a decade later and it never fails to bring me back.

When the actual teaser trailer came up, I remember STOPPING EVERYTHING I was doing and dashed to my actual laptop and watched it.

And when the actual official trailer was dropped, I was in school back then. Nobody knew what the fuck Godzilla was so I never heard about it until I went home. And when I did find out that the trailer came out, I sat my action figure with me and watched it, acting like it was watching with me too. That shit was EVERYTHING to me. I just transferred to my new school that time and I felt lonely, being in that moment reinvigorated me man.

I vehemently avoided the internet, treating it like a plague. I won't spoil myself, I promised. The release date in the Philippines was at May 10, so a day after my birthday. Before we left for the mall, my aunt gifted me with two new figures, a Mechagodzilla and a Burning Godzilla figure.

When my mom and I went to the mall to celebrate my birthday, she took me to the exact mall I bought my first figure. I brought him and my new Burning one to the cinema with me. It was also my FIRST time at a movie theater.

So, I sat both figures on each arm rest and carefully made sure not to knock them down while watching. I remember being the only kid there doing that LOLOLOL. All the other kids were staring at me when I went inside the theater, holding my two toys. I felt like the COOLEST kid ever.

Okay, now tk the stuff that actually matters to you LMFAO.

Monster films in general always interested me, even if they weren't strictly Godzilla. Something about man being pitted against something beyond his comprehension **fascinated** me. Will man work with each other to conquer the threat, or pull each other down in an effort to survive? In a world of monsters, will race matter? Will religion matter? Will ideology matter? Will it ally with the monster or will it shatter everything and leave man bare, naked and primitive? How will humanity respond? That's what has always hooked me in.

For Godzilla specifically, the first thing I look at is how the film will treat him: villain, hero, or anti-hero? Godzilla is often a symbol for something.

In the orignal 1954 film, Godzilla was an allegory for the terrors of atomic weaponry. Fresh from the atomic bombings, seeing this giant irradiated monster should make people feel dread. When you see this monster, you need to be reminded about the price you pay for using atomic weapons that bring nothing but terror, death and untold destruction.

In the later films of the Showa era, Godzilla was turned into something akin to a children's hero. He'd fight monsters, protecting the planet from fellow monsters or those from the stars. He was a force for good, even if he acts like he doesn't want to. You don't expect a giant lizard that can shoot

Sometimes he's an anti-hero. In the 2014 movie, that's exactly what he is. An anti-hero Godzilla is also my favorite rendition of Godzilla, because he gets to be both hero and villain at the same time LMFAO—the best of both worlds. That's why I like the Legendary, or shall I say, his Monsterverse rendition. You can't really expect what he'll do when he appears. Is he gonna wreck things or is he gonna help? There's that constant tension present, and it makes for absolute cinema if it's used correctly.

Now, one of the most recurring themes of Godzilla is tragedy. No matter which incarnation it is, from his goofiest and heroic to his most malevolent and devious, there's always a sense of tragedy following him. It's honestly the most captivating thing about him for me, aside from his abilities.

“Monsters are tragic beings; they are born too tall, too strong, too heavy, they are not evil by choice. That is their tragedy” — Ishiro Honda (Godzilla 1954)

Even if Godzilla is a force for good, humanity might still distrust him, ending in fallout. If Godzilla's evil, you can't help but feel pity for him if he's characterized well, or in Minus One's case, you can't help but want him to just die. When he's a neutral force, how long do you expect him to remain that way? When will he pick a side? This sense of tragedy that follows him wherever he goes is what I believe lends him the ability to be so flexible in media. He's a tragic reflection of humanity. And that's why I love this giant lizard, and just because he's cool as fuck.

Seeing in cameos are always so hype LMFAO, and you know they almost always treat him well. There's this anime movie, where it's just a bunch big-time Japanese culture landmarks, from Evangelion to Godzilla, and the latter is just treated as this unstoppable thing that the protagonists can't beat. It's hilarious.
