MERRY CHRISTMAS, MGA KUPALORDS!!!!

Alam niyo ba that I'm so so so grateful for you both. Usually wala akong kausap, maliban kay Dan BAHSHAHHAHAA, so kayo talaga una't sa lahat pinupuntahan ko.

I know na mahirap ang college for all of us, and I'm so proud of you both because in spite of such hardships, you still came out on top. Nakakabilib talaga kayo. Both of you are my academic inspirations.

Okay, YUCK. Naging glazer si kuya niyo. Pero, deserve niyo naman 😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰 so I don't care. I will glaze and glaze!!!!

Anyway. The contents of this letter will be nothing more than me saying that I value your presences in my life. I am grateful for you both for being my friends.

OKAY, NEXT GALA WHERE???? SANA SA MOA AHSHAHAHAHAHA

I love you guys, stay determined and stay excellent. Need natin maging drug empire.
