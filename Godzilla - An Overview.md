# Overview

- From volatility to solemnity. 
	- Time and experience has tempered his rage.
	- He is no longer a furious beast but a creature burdened with the weight of responsibility. 
	- His fury, however, is only restrained.
		- He is not afraid to unleash his power should it be necessary to do so.
- He is a descendant of the *Northern Gojira*. 
	- His penchant for stoicism and resilience is derived from this heritage.
- He is a Null, a classification of species who do not possess any affinity for magic now and forever.
	- However, he and his species possesses command over energy itself.
		- This is an ability inherent to his species.
			- However, only *now* did he realize its limitless potential. 
				- Before, his species understood this ability as an affinity for nuclear energy.
					- They could only sense, absorb, and weaponize it, with the latter being expressed as their ultimate weapon *the Atomic Breath*.
					- Their understanding was limited by instinct and stubbornness. 
				- Godzilla, bound by his Titan perspective, the stubbornness of his species, doubled by the stubbornness inherited from his father, compounded by his own personal brand of stubbornness.
- The Antitheriomorphosis has forced him into a human that possesses the same power to control atomic energy.
	- No longer a colossus, a living nuclear reactor, he must approach his situation from a different angle.
		- More than ever, he has to rely on his species' inherent ability to be limitlessly adaptable.
