Okay, now let's explore some hairstyles for him. I think my description is a little too vague for him. What do you think could he rock? Additionally, what other aspects of his head hair can we develop?

The best I could do is that it's tapered at the sides and back, has enough length at the top to be swept back if needed and to fall on his forehead just above his brow. It's rather textured than smooth (a hint of his rugged self, that only becomes more prominent if he doesn't shave or during dormant periods). He typically just uses his hand to style it back since conventional products and items fail him. 

Also, when it comes to maintenance or cutting. His first five or so haircuts were done with barbers, but each time he was learning how to properly do it. By his 2nd appointment, he could already cut his own hair but remained to gather more 'intel', on his next cut, he will be doing it himself. Self-sufficiency is a necessary skill in the world of Titans, and since he sits at the top, he must embody it. Other Titans like Rodan or Bakunawa will often have lengthy sessions to get their hair correctly though, not because they can't do it themselves, far from it, but because they find conversation pleasant and the process thrilling for some unknown reason.

Maria is especially weak to him when his hair is all damp and it falls on his head... well, she's weak to a damp Godric and a half-naked one required her absolute control to not cause a scene between them. She appears calm and serene, but panicking on the inside. This only fueled Godric to be mindful as he could tell her 'discomfort'.


# Developing Godric's Hair

Okay, let's develop Godric's hairstyle further than the vague description I gave you. Unfortunately, I don't have precise knowledge of men's haircuts to flesh out what I have envisioned. I have the image, but I don't know how to describe it. Thus, I will have to lean on you for its actualization.

## The Description

Godric's hair is short on the sides and the back and longer at the top. It has enough length on the top to be swept back and for some strands to fall on his forehead. However, his preferred length is usually just above the brow - any longer than that and he will consider cutting. 

It's rather textured than smooth and can be slightly tousled throughout the day, especially if he's doing physical work. The strands that fall on his hair are typically tendrils that dance across his forehead when he works; it adds that deliciously masculine and virile ruggedness that enthralls women and some men alike - Maria is most affected, as per usual. This quality only becomes more prominent during his dormant period, wherein he will shave less as he sleeps for several days straight. 

## Self-Sufficiency 

When it comes to maintenance and grooming, Godric initially had his hair done by barbers hired by Monarch. Typically these people were already existing staff in Castle Bravo, or they had to be brought in from other outposts. Mark figured this works better than having to hire someone then make them swear secrecy or offer them a job at an outpost. Luckily, Nordson is addicted to self-sufficiency. After all, in the world of Titans it is one of the keys to survival; and as the Titan at the top of the hierarchy, he has a duty to embody this more than anyone else - in spite of everyone doing their own thing anyway. It seems this is less of a status signal and more of a personal preference. In contrast, Rodan and Bakunawa love staying for hours with a barber or a stylist just to chat and explore hairstyles.

His first five haircuts were primarily done by said barbers. However, Godric was already analyzing them in order to be able to do it himself. By his second appointment, he already possessed enough theory to be able to do it himself - and he would have succeeded had he tried. However, patient and meticulous as he is, he opted to "gather more intel", silently eyeing the poor hair cutter who seemed to be incredibly intimidated. Not only does he have to learn new tools to cut this man's hair, he has to deal with his eyes snapping and tracking onto every movement he does. Once he had his fifth and most recent appointment, he was already fully capable of achieving the cut he currently wears, able to replicate and optimize it further for his use. Madison also remarked that he could be a barber himself, with eyes and hand-eye coordination like his, who knows how well he could've done. 

For his next cut, which would be soon, he has several plans and ideas. 

## Maria's Dilemma

Maria finds his hair "distracting". There is nothing more to it - certainly. Sure she can see that tendril of hair swaying across his forehead and visions of herself sweeping them back into his head while caressing his cheek - and oops, that's not intended. His hair is fascinating. He used to have none, and now he has them. Big deal, right?

Then in the winter of 2020, it changed. He just woke up, went for a swim, and she was outside his pool wanting to talk about human traditions done in winter. 

The interaction was simple and straightforward. She asked for permission, he opened the door. She saw his damp hair, water dripping into his half-naked form, a strong stubble framing his face
