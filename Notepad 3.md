# Developing Godric's Hair

Okay, let's develop Godric's hairstyle further than the vague description I gave you. Unfortunately, I don't have precise knowledge of men's haircuts to flesh out what I have envisioned. I have the image, but I don't know how to describe it. Thus, I will have to lean on you for its actualization. Additionally, what other aspects of his head hair can we develop?

## The Description

Godric's hair is slightly shorter on the sides and the back and slightly longer at the top. It has enough length on the top to be swept back and for some strands to fall on his forehead. However, his preferred length is usually just above the brow - any longer than that and he will consider cutting. 

His hair in general is rather textured than smooth and can be slightly tousled throughout the day, especially if he's doing physical work. The strands that fall on his hair are typically tendrils that dance across his forehead when he works; it adds that deliciously masculine and virile ruggedness that enthralls women and some men alike - Maria is most affected, as per usual. This quality only becomes more prominent during his dormant period, wherein he will shave less as he sleeps for several days straight.

I think it looks business like? I don't know the term, but it looks professional yet has potential to make him look even more rugged.

## Self-Sufficiency

When it comes to maintenance and grooming, Godric initially had his hair done by barbers hired by Monarch. Typically these people were already existing staff in Castle Bravo, or they had to be brought in from other outposts. Mark figured this works better than having to hire someone then make them swear secrecy or offer them a job at an outpost. Luckily, Nordson is addicted to self-sufficiency. After all, in the world of Titans it is one of the keys to survival; and as the Titan at the top of the hierarchy, he has a duty to embody this more than anyone else - in spite of everyone doing their own thing anyway. It seems this is less of a status signal and more of a personal preference. In contrast, Rodan and Bakunawa love staying for hours with a barber or a stylist just to chat and explore hairstyles.

His first five haircuts were primarily done by said barbers. However, Godric was already analyzing them in order to be able to do it himself. By his second appointment, he already possessed enough theory to be able to do it himself - and he would have succeeded had he tried. However, patient and meticulous as he is, he opted to “gather more intel”, silently eyeing the poor hair cutter who seemed to be incredibly intimidated. Not only does he have to learn new tools *just to be able to even* cut this man's hair, he has to deal with his eyes snapping and tracking onto every movement he does. Once he had his fifth and most recent appointment, he was already fully capable of achieving the cut he currently wears, able to replicate and optimize it further for his use. Madison also remarked that he could be a barber himself, with eyes and hand-eye coordination like his, who knows how well he could've done.

For his next cut, which would be soon, he has several plans and ideas. 

He has also considered adding products, but find that they deteriorate far too quickly due to his biology.

## Maria's Dilemma

Maria finds his hair “distracting”. There is nothing more to it - certainly. Sure she can see that tendril of hair swaying across his forehead and visions of herself sweeping them back into his head while caressing his cheek - and oops, that's not intended. His hair is fascinating. He used to have none, and now he has them. Big deal, right?

Then in the winter of 2020, it changed. He just woke up, went for a swim, and she was outside his pool wanting to talk about human traditions done in winter.

The interaction was simple and straightforward. She asked for permission, he opened the door. She saw his damp hair that fell on his forehead, long and tousled;water dripping into his half-naked form, a strong stubble framing his face; his tired blue eyes looking at her and…

She froze. Her eyes followed the thicker bush of hair on his chest, down on to his navel - her vision seeming to follow a water droplet flowing down on to his softer muscles. The droplet faded on to his trunks, and she willed her eyes to look at his chest instead rather than bother to even look at what's *down there*.

That was the last time she saw Godric like that because he began to wear his undershirt before opening the door. The Alpha Paramount never apologizes, not even to her; but, she has known her since Pangea, since they were in their youth, and she could see the slight apologetic expression on his eyes.

Stupid Maria, ruining such a *fantastic* view like that. If she could just get a hold of herself, he might have not done that.

Oh Heaven help her, guide her, and give her strength... A damp, bulky, and rugged Godric is her weakness.

She eagerly avoided him until December, only to then find out that *no*... it's not *just* a damp Godric she finds, as the humans call it, *hot*;

### The Cyle

But their cycle continues: 
- he does something
- she likes it 
- he thinks he''s being improper, so he "fixes" it
- she thinks he's disinterested
- he notices her too much
- she doesn't seem ready for anything romantical
- he doesn't even bother, because "why would she bother with him"
- he does something new
- she likes it

The cycle repeats ad infinitum.
