# Developing Godric's Hair

Okay, let's develop Godric's hairstyle further than the vague description I gave you. Unfortunately, I don't have precise knowledge of men's haircuts to flesh out what I have envisioned. I have the image, but I don't know how to describe it. Thus, I will have to lean on you for its actualization. Additionally, what other aspects of his head hair can we develop?

## The Description

Godric's hair is somewhere between short to medium-length.

When he prepares for the day, he sweeps it back into a side part.

However, when he does any sort of physical activity, the length allows some strands to stray and fall down on his forehead. They dance across its surface, dangling rather than stiffly moving - it adds that deliciously masculine and virile ruggedness that enthralls women and some men alike - Maria most affected, as per usual.

His hair in general is soft to the touch, but develops a slightly tousled appearance over the course of the day, especially if he's doing physical work. This quality only becomes more prominent during his dormant period, wherein he will shave less as he sleeps for several days straight.

When I try to imagine Godric's hair, I envision a mix of a cowboy's and a businessman's hair; his signature blend of refined ruggedness/rugged refinement shining through

What do you think? What could this be? I can imagine him wearing some classical styles.

## Self-Sufficiency

When it comes to maintenance and grooming, Godric initially had his hair done by barbers hired by Monarch. Typically these people were already existing staff in Castle Bravo, or they had to be brought in from other outposts. Mark figured this works better than having to hire someone then make them swear secrecy or offer them a job at an outpost. Luckily, Nordson is addicted to self-sufficiency. After all, in the world of Titans it is one of the keys to survival; and as the Titan at the top of the hierarchy, he has a duty to embody this more than anyone else - in spite of everyone doing their own thing anyway. It seems this is less of a status signal and more of a personal preference. In contrast, Rodan and Bakunawa love staying for hours with a barber or a stylist just to chat and explore hairstyles.

His first five haircuts were primarily done by said barbers. However, Godric was already analyzing them in order to be able to do it himself. By his second appointment, he already possessed enough theory to be able to do it himself - and he would have succeeded had he tried. However, patient and meticulous as he is, he opted to “gather more intel”, silently eyeing the poor hair cutter who seemed to be incredibly intimidated. Not only does he have to learn new tools *just to be able to even* cut this man's hair, he has to deal with his eyes snapping and tracking onto every movement he does. Once he had his fifth and most recent appointment, he was already fully capable of achieving the cut he currently wears, able to replicate and optimize it further for his use. Madison also remarked that he could be a barber himself, with eyes and hand-eye coordination like his, who knows how well he could've done.

For his next cut, which would be soon, he has several plans and ideas, most of which point to a crew cut of sorts. It's marginally longer than a buzz cut but shorter that some tendrils don't fall anymore.

He has also considered adding products, but find that they deteriorate far too quickly due to his biology.

## Maria's Dilemma

Maria finds his hair “distracting”. There is nothing more to it - certainly. Sure she can see that tendril of hair swaying across his forehead and visions of herself sweeping them back into his head while caressing his cheek - and oops, that's not intended. His hair is fascinating. He used to have none, and now he has them. Big deal, right?

Then in the winter of 2020, it changed. He just woke up, went for a swim, and she was outside his pool wanting to talk about human traditions done in winter.

The interaction was simple and straightforward. She asked for permission, he opened the door. She saw his damp hair that fell on his forehead, long and tousled;water dripping into his half-naked form, a strong stubble framing his face; his tired blue eyes looking at her and…

She froze. Her eyes followed the thicker bush of hair on his chest, down on to his navel - her vision seeming to follow a water droplet flowing down on to his softer muscles. The droplet faded on to his trunks, and she willed her eyes to look at his chest instead rather than bother to even look at what's *down there*.

That was the last time she saw Godric like that because he began to wear his undershirt before opening the door. The Alpha Paramount never apologizes, not even to her; but, she has known her since Pangea, since they were in their youth, and she could see the slight apologetic expression on his eyes.

Stupid Maria, ruining such a *fantastic* view like that. If she could just get a hold of herself, he might have not done that.

Oh Heaven help her, guide her, and give her strength… A damp, bulky, and rugged Godric is her weakness.

She eagerly avoided him until December, only to then find out that *no*… it's not *just* a damp Godric she finds, as the humans call it, *hot*;

### The Cyle

But their cycle continues:
- he does something
- she likes it
- he thinks he''s being improper, so he “fixes” it
- she thinks he's disinterested
- he notices her too much
- she doesn't seem ready for anything romantical
- he doesn't even bother, because “why would she bother with him”
- he does something new
- she likes it

The cycle repeats ad infinitum.

## Distinctive Physical Characteristics

### Density & Weight Distribution

Godric possesses extraordinary tissue density that creates disconnect between appearance and capability:

| Tissue Type | Godric's Density | Human Average | Ratio |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| Bone | 2.6 g/cm³ | 1.5-1.8 g/cm³ | ~1.6× greater |
| Muscle | 1.9 g/cm³ | 1.06 g/cm³ | ~1.8× greater |
| Organ Tissue | ~1.3× human average | Varies | ~1.3× greater |
| Connective Tissue | ~1.5× human average | Varies | ~1.5× greater |

### Region-Specific Weight Distribution

| Body Region | Percentage of Mass | Human Average | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| Torso | 48% | 43-45% | **Titan Echo: Higher mass percentage for energy core** |
| Arms | 15% | 13-14% | **Titan Echo: Denser musculature for combat** |
| Legs | 33% | 35-37% | Proportionally balanced |
| Head | 4% | 7-8% | **Titan Echo: More efficient neural structure** |

### Perpetual Readiness (Relaxed vs. Flexed)

One of Godric's most distinctive physical traits is his minimal change between relaxed and flexed states. This creates a perpetual impression of readiness even at rest:

- Upper arm expansion when flexed: +6.2%
- Forearm expansion when flexed: +4.0%
- Chest expansion when flexed: +3.4%
- Thigh expansion when flexed: +4.2%

This reduced muscle expansion parallels his perpetually blue eyes (vs. true gold), symbolizing his constant vigilance. Even at rest, his muscles remain partially engaged, ready for immediate action.

### Proximity Effect

Humans experience a predictable pattern of responses based on proximity to Godric:

| Distance | Conscious Response | Subconscious Response |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| >15 meters | Conventional attraction | Normal social interest |
| 5-15 meters | Recognition of unusual perfection | Growing unease with attraction |
| <5 meters | Awareness of commanding presence | Fight-or-flight activation |

### Titan Echoes

Specific anatomical features that preserve aspects of his Titan form:

1. **Back Structure**: Expanded width and deeper musculature where dorsal fins would attach
2. **Neck Development**: Thicker than proportions would suggest, reflecting his powerful Titan neck
3. **Thigh Mass**: Enhanced thickness and power where his primary Titan stability originated
4. **Core Depth**: Deeper chest and abdominal cavity reflecting his atomic energy storage
5. **Joint Reinforcement**: Thicker wrists, ankles and knees from supporting titanic weight
6. **Forearm Development**: Slightly longer and thicker for combat superiority
7. **Foot Structure**: Wider with enhanced heel for stability inherited from Titan stance

## Seasonal Variation Analysis

### Active Season (December-August)

- Body Fat: 10-12%
- Muscle Definition: Highly pronounced
- Facial Features: Angular and defined
- Temperature: 100.9°F (38.3°C)
- Overall Appearance: Classical sculpture precision
- Human Perception: Intimidating perfection

### Dormant Season (September-November)

- Body Fat: 15-18%
- Muscle Definition: Softer but still visible
- Facial Features: Slightly rounded
- Temperature: 99.5°F (37.5°C)
- Overall Appearance: Rugged wilderness vitality
- Human Perception: More approachable yet powerful

The dormant season transformation creates a physique that appears more conventionally human while maintaining impressive proportions. The additional mass softens his angular features, creating a rugged appearance that paradoxically seems more natural and approachable despite technically being further from his optimal state.

## Titan Spectrum Positioning

### Comparative Arm Analysis

| Titan | Upper Arm | Forearm | Wrist | Position | Combat Style |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Anguirus** | 18.5” (47cm) | 15” (38.1cm) | 9” (22.9cm) | Ground Extreme | Defensive/Endurance |
| **Godric** | 17.5” (44.5cm) | 14.8” (37.6cm) | 9.2” (23.4cm) | Ground-Leaning | Balanced Power |
| **Kong** | 16” (40.6cm) | 13” (33cm) | 8” (20.3cm) | Air-Leaning | Tactical Mobility |
| **Rodan** | 15” (38.1cm) | 12” (30.5cm) | 7.5” (19.1cm) | Air Extreme | Speed/Agility |

## Connection to Maria

### Physical Contrast and Appeal

The connection between Godric and Maria's physical forms creates rich narrative parallels:

1. **Perfection Spectrum**: While Godric approaches but never reaches perfect golden ratio (1.61 vs 1.618), Maria embodies true mathematical perfection (1.618) - reflecting her divine nature versus his mortal one
2. **Seasonal Attraction**: Maria finds Godric most attractive during his dormant season, when he appears furthest from “perfection” but closest to authentic mortality - symbolizing her attraction to his mortality and will rather than his power
3. **Eye-Physique Parallel**: Just as his gold eyes (true self) occasionally peek through his vigilant blue, his dormant physique reveals glimpses of vulnerability beneath his guardian persona
4. **Visual Metaphor**: Maria's attraction to his less “perfect” dormant state represents her deeper understanding of him - seeing beyond the perfect protector to the authentic being beneath
5. **Divine-Mortal Connection**: Her divine perfection drawn to his mortal determination creates the core emotional tension between them - immortality finding meaning through connection with mortality

This physical dynamic creates a powerful visual representation of their deeper relationship: perfection finding value not in itself but in authentic connection with imperfection.
