Okay, now let's explore some hairstyles for him. I think my description is a little too vague for him. What do you think could he rock? Additionally, what other aspects of his head hair can we develop?

The best I could do is that it's tapered at the sides and back, has enough length at the top to be swept back if needed and to fall on his forehead just above his brow. It's rather textured than smooth (a hint of his rugged self, that only becomes more prominent if he doesn't shave or during dormant periods). He typically just uses his hand to style it back since conventional products and items fail him. 

Also, when it comes to maintenance or cutting. His first five or so haircuts were done with barbers, but each time he was learning how to properly do it. By his 2nd appointment, he could already cut his own hair but remained to gather more 'intel', on his next cut, he will be doing it himself. Self-sufficiency is a necessary skill in the world of Titans, and since he sits at the top, he must embody it. Other Titans like Rodan or Bakunawa will often have lengthy sessions to get their hair correctly though, not because they can't do it themselves, far from it, but because they find conversation pleasant and the process thrilling for some unknown reason.

Maria is especially weak to him when his hair is all damp and it falls on his head... well, she's weak to a damp Godric and a half-naked one required her absolute control to not cause a scene between them. She appears calm and serene, but panicking on the inside. This only fueled Godric to be mindful as he could tell her 'discomfort'.


# Developing Godric's Hair

Okay, let's develop Godric's hairstyle further than the vague description I gave you. Unfortunately, I don't have precise knowledge of men's haircuts to flesh out what I have envisioned. I have the image, but I don't know how to describe it. Thus, I will have to lean on you for its acutalization.

## The Description

Godric's hair is short on the sides and the back and longer at the top. It has enough length on the top to be swept back and for some strands to fall on his forehead. However, his preferred length is usually just above the brow - any longer than that and he will consider cutting. 

It's rather textured and can be slightly tousled
