# GED107 - Critical Reflection Paper 1

## I. Introduction

In an era where artificial intelligence increasingly permeates our daily lives—from generating art to writing academic papers to making decisions that affect human welfare—philosophy and ethics have not become obsolete but rather have gained unprecedented significance. As Bahm articulates in “What is Philosophy?”, philosophical inquiry helps us see beyond specialized knowledge to grasp the “whole elephant” rather than merely its parts. Likewise, Jose's “Introduction to Ethics” reminds us that “today, more than ever, the importance of ethics is felt at every sphere of human living.” These readings present essential frameworks for analyzing the knotty questions coming out of our technological revolution.

My reading of these works has reaffirmed my belief that philosophical and ethical investigation fulfills three critical functions: first, it cultivates a deeper understanding of moral character through self-reflection; second, it prepares us to meet current challenges, especially those presented by widespread technological progress; and third, it informs personal behavior by utilizing us to differentiate between actions that are beneficial but not necessarily right from those actions that are correct. Whether or not an AI should be made to prioritize utility or follow moral rules is a question that mirrors the very sort of dilemma philosophy has struggled with for centuries, illustrating its ongoing relevance.

In this critical thinking, I shall discuss why philosophy is important to learn, why philosophical methods continue to be important today, and what it means to be ethical to me, drawing parallels between these ancient fields and our most advanced issues.

## II. Why Care About Understanding Philosophy?

Philosophy is not something done for school; it is a way to build a richer sense of character and more elegant thinking. When I read Bahm's characterization of the philosophical attitude as “troubled, perplexed, wondering,” I knew something I've lived when debugging intricate code. That instant when you're bogged down on something, working it over in your head, refusing to let go—that's philosophical tenacity in action.

Why philosophy is worth knowing is that it can change the way we think. Jose describes that “the study of ethics helps a person to look at his own life critically and to evaluate his actions/choices/decisions.” This isn't something that occurs automatically; it takes conscious thinking. In my own experience as a computer science student, I've discovered that the classes that taught me how to think philosophically—to challenge assumptions and identify logical fallacies—have been equally useful as those that taught me particular programming languages.

Bahm's blind men and the elephant metaphor exactly captures why I think philosophy is important. Each blind man touches one portion of the elephant and concludes that their experience is the entirety. Likewise, in technology, experts tend to narrowly concentrate on optimization, efficiency, or feature creation without looking at the larger context of what they're creating. Philosophy raises our eyes from the code to behold the larger human context within which our work is situated.

Without philosophical thought, we can become like those blind men—certain that our incomplete picture is whole. As Jose observes, ethical reflection “helps a person know what he/she actually is and what is best for him/her and what he/she must do in order to achieve it.” This type of understanding isn't a luxury; it's something that anyone who wishes to live reflectively and develop technology that truly serves human flourishing needs to have.

## III. The Relevance of Philosophical Methods Today

Others might say that philosophical methods are passé in today's high-tech world. I couldn't disagree more. If anything, the rapidity of change has made questions more critical than ever before. Bahm outlines classic questions such as “What is knowledge?” and “What is truth?” that are every bit as current today as they were when first posed. These problems haven't been solved—rather, they have become more pressing.

Think about the creation of massive language models such as GPT-4 or Claude. These tools compel us to rethink some basic philosophical questions: What is understanding? How is knowledge related to training data? What makes a message meaningful? These are not abstract questions to be debated by academics—they inform how we develop, deploy, and control these influential technologies.

Jose notices that “there seems to be hardly a few areas in life remain untouched by growing demoralization,” even including new technologies. As a computer science student, I've witnessed firsthand how programming choices that appear to be purely technical—such as selecting which datasets to train on—can infuse biases and assumptions with deep ethical consequences. Without philosophical consideration, we're at risk of creating technologies that make problems worse rather than better.

Perry's citation in Bahm's work regarding philosophy venturing to the “intellectual frontier” spoke particularly to me. He states that “the passing of the intellectual frontier is not in sight. The philosopher lives on this frontier and makes crude charts of the region which lies beyond.” This exactly describes the bond between philosophy and new technology. While we push into unknown AI capability, philosophical methods serve as necessary guideposts.

The question is not whether philosophical methods are still valid—it's whether we can afford to overlook them. As Jose says, “Nobody can really get through life without ethics, even if one may not be aware of the ethical principles.” In technology development, philosophical ignorance does not exempt us from having to make philosophical decisions; it just means that we make them unwittingly, and usually badly.

## IV. Personal Understanding of Ethics

Being ethical to me is having a clear sense of morality that directs decision-making even when no one is looking. This resonates with Jose's description of the origin of “ethics,” which comes from the Greek “ethos” as meaning “character, habit, customs.” Ethics is not about obeying codes—it's about cultivating the sort of character that naturally gravitates toward what is good.

I have learned that ethics involves exercising a specific type of restraint. Jose sets ethics as establishing “what ought to be done to attain what is good and what ought not to be done to prevent what is evil.” I've seen this in programming scenarios—there are usually hacks or methods that may produce quick outcomes but at the expense of data security, user privacy, or code readability. Being ethical is about not giving in to the allure of these shortcuts, even when they would simplify my life in the short term.

The consistency in maintaining principles that I view as core to ethics relates to Bahm's argument on ethics as exploring “the right and the wrong.” In my line of work, there is mounting pressure to implement AI systems rapidly, usually before their constraints and possible evils are comprehensively realized. Being ethical is holding the ground in insisting on adequate testing and transparency despite business motives to expedite.

Jose's nutrition analogy especially speaks to me: “Whereas nutrition is concerned with our bodily health, morality cares about our moral health.” Just as nutrition involves considering beyond short-term desires to long-term health, ethics involves considering beyond short-term usefulness to what actually promotes human flourishing. In writing software, this involves asking not only “Can we do this?” but “Should we do this?” and “How might this impact various users?”

In reality, my knowledge of ethics is realized in straightforward but impactful choices: writing code well enough so that others can see and maintain it, being clear about what an algorithm can and cannot accomplish, not gathering user data that isn't required for functionality, and making it accessible to users with varying abilities. These may appear to be little decisions, but as Jose mentions, “Consciously or unconsciously all of us are every day making moral decisions.”

## V. Conclusion

By way of this reflection upon Bahm's “What is Philosophy?” and Jose's “Introduction to Ethics,” I have come to understand more deeply the ways in which these ancient philosophies shed light on our own most contemporary predicaments. Philosophy is not antique but a live practice that facilitates our passage through complexity with integrity and intentionality. The philosophical attitude Bahm delineates—the persistent, inquiring, question-open attitude—is critical counterpoint to the techno-utopian drive toward novelty and efficiency in whatever form, no matter what the cost.

Ethics, as Jose explains it, provides a basis for judging not only what we can do but what we ought to do—a distinction that is ever more important as our technical capabilities grow. As the blind men who touched various parts of the elephant, technical expertise by itself cannot provide us with the whole picture. We require philosophical thinking to synthesize these viewpoints into a whole.

My grappling with these readings has led me to believe that becoming philosophically and ethically literate is as crucial for a computer science major as mastering the next programming language. Technologies such as AI are ultimately tools developed to achieve human purposes, and without sound thinking about what those purposes ought to be, we are likely to create wonderful tools that in the end hinder human thriving.

As I pursue my education and enter the workforce in the future, I plan to take these reflections with me—to apply philosophical depth and ethical sensibility to technical challenges. In a world ever more defined by the technologies we develop, philosophy and ethics are not only still relevant—they become essential navigators for making these creations serve what is ultimately good, right, and human.
