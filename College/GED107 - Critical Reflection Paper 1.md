## ## Introduction

With artificial intelligence seeping into every aspect of our lives these days—creating art, writing academic papers, and making decisions impacting human welfare—philosophy and ethics have not become outdated but have instead assumed unprecedented relevance. As Bahm explains in “What is Philosophy?”, philosophical inquiry allows us to transcend specialized knowledge in order to perceive the “whole elephant” instead of its constituent parts.

Likewise, Jose's “Introduction to Ethics” reminds us that “today, more than ever, the importance of ethics is felt at every sphere of human living.” These readings are important frameworks for looking at the complex questions arising from our technological revolution. My reflection on these pieces has reaffirmed my belief that philosophical and ethical inquiry has three purposes that are necessary: first, it cultivates a deeper understanding of moral character by means of critical self-reflection; second, it prepares us to face challenges of the present, especially those presented by technologies that are advancing rapidly; and third, it informs personal behavior through assisting us in differentiating between actions that are simply good and actions that are right.

The question of whether or not an AI is to be taught to maximize utility or to maximize adherence to ethical principles is exactly the sort of dilemma that has been debated throughout the centuries, showing the field's continued utility.

Through this critical examination, I will analyze why it matters to learn philosophy, why philosophic methods continue to be so important today, and what I believe being ethical entails, highlighting the connections between these ancient methods and our newest, most contemporary concerns.

## II. Why Care to Understand Philosophy? To Understand Philosophy is to Attain a Deeper and More Comprehensive Sense of Character and Be Able to Cultivate Elegant Behaviors and Thoughts. Bahm Defines the Philosophical Frame of Mind as “troubled, Perplexed, wondering,” “reflective,” and “persistent,” Defining Philosophy as “an Obstinate Effort to Think clearly.” Persistent Inquiry Doesn't just Gather knowledge—it Changes the Inquirer.

When we take up what Bahm refers to as the “philosophical attitude,” we form intellectual virtues such as open-mindedness, tolerance, and being willing to revise our beliefs on the basis of new evidence.

Jose expounds this transformative element, stating that “the study of ethics makes an individual analyze his own life critically and judge his actions/choices/decisions.” This critical self-reflection is not merely theoretical; it “helps a person realize what he/she actually is and what is best for him/her and what he/she needs to do in order to achieve it.” In my own experience as a computer science student, this philosophical mindset has helped me to think more about questioning assumptions built into algorithms and systems, instead of mindlessly applying them without regard for their larger consequences. Bahm's metaphor of blind men and an elephant strongly depicts how unique knowledge, without philosophical integration, results in partial understanding. He points out that “when a scientist insists that the whole universe is like the part which he investigates, he is to be compared to a Burmese blind man.” And in systems design and programming, that global view is worth its weight in gold—it avoids the myopia of concentrating on technical feasibility at the expense of human, social, and ethical factors.

Knowing philosophy gives us the conceptual frameworks required to synthesize specialized knowledge into a coherent whole, especially critical in areas such as computer science that touch upon nearly every part of human existence.

## III. Relevance of Philosophical Approaches Today Philosophical Approaches Continue to Be Relevant Today because We, Human Beings, Will Always Have grounds to Question what We Know, Think, Do, and Believe. Bahm Recognizes Classic Philosophical Questions such as “What is Knowledge?

“, “What is truth? “, and “What is purpose? ” that are no less pressing today than they were for Socrates.

Jose adds to this timelessness, affirming that “consciously or unconsciously all of us are every day making moral decisions.” Those essential questions don't become outdated with technological progress—they become even more critical. With the development of AI, philosophical questioning assumes new dimensions. Think about the philosophical issue of personal identity: if an AI program can simulate human speech or generate art indistinguishable from work created by a human, then we need to go back and ask again what is original thought and what is genuine human expression.

As Jose notes, “the power of traditional religions to inspire moral conduct continues to decline,” leaving a void that rational philosophical ethics will have to fill, especially with regard to emerging technologies that no traditional moral scheme ever envisioned.

Perry's metaphor (cited by Bahm) regarding philosophy venturing the “intellectual frontier” aptly describes why philosophical methods continue to be relevant: “The physical frontier, we are told, has ceased to exist… But the passing of the intellectual frontier is not in sight.”.

There is ample open land outside the areas which religion and the sciences have fenced and cultivated.” In building AI systems, we repeatedly find ourselves in uncharted ethical territory—issues of machine consciousness, algorithmic bias, or the appropriate boundaries of automation. These are not just technical issues but philosophical ones involving the “persistent attempt to solve problems” Bahm finds to be typical of philosophy.

## IV. Personal Understanding of Ethics Being Ethical to Me is about Having a Good Sense of Moral character—a view that Has come out Clearly in Jose's Definition that “ethics” Comes from the Greek “ethos” and Refers to “character, Habit, customs.” This Origin Shows that Ethics is not so much a Matter of Obeying Rules but Cultivating Good Character that Tends toward Right Action Naturally. As Jose Puts It, “morality Has to Do More with One's Interior Self than the Practice of Some Customs or Set rules.” The Ethical Person Exhibits Restraint, Consistently Choosing what is Moral over what Might Be Immediately Beneficial but Morally Questionable.

This is the refrain of Jose's definition of ethics as determining “what ought to be done to achieve what is good and what ought not to be done to avoid what is evil.” His nutrition metaphor well suits his aim: “Just as nutrition emphasizes our bodily welfare, morality thinks about our spiritual well-being.” Just as we may skip the short-term pleasurable consumption for long-term wellness, the moral person skips short-term advantage for moral wholesomeness. Consistency in maintaining what is right and true despite individual repercussions is, in my opinion, a distinguishing feature of ethical conduct.

Bahm mentions ethics as being the study of “the right and the wrong,” citing that ethics explores “how to know when an act is right.” This is not determined situationally or egocentrically but based on principles.

As Jose explains, ethics “seeks to improve our lives, to enable us to live better lives” by giving “a common perspective from which we can come to consensus on what all of us should do.

These ethical precepts in computer science and AI programming bear down as real practices: revealing algorithms' limitations, not compromising user privacy, avoiding exploitation of technical weaknesses, and crafting systems that increase rather than curtail human autonomy and dignity.

While coding an AI system, the ethical coder doesn't simply pose “Can we do this? ” but “Should we do this? “—and “If we build it, how do we make it serve human flourishing instead of technological progress?”undefined” This kind of ethical orientation demands exactly the sort of “philosophical attitude” Bahm outlines: reflective, open-minded, guided by reason, and focused on the whole instead of the parts.undefined## V. Conclusion Philosophy and ethics, far from being abstract academic exercises, provide essential frameworks for navigating our increasingly complex world. As Bahm's analysis of philosophical attitudes and Jose's exploration of ethical foundations demonstrate, these disciplines equip us with tools for critical self-examination, holistic understanding, and principled action. The philosophical approach—characterized by persistent questioning, open-mindedness, and synthesis of specialized knowledge—remains vital for addressing contemporary challenges, particularly those posed by emerging technologies. The ethical framework—based on character building, self-restraint, and firm adherence to moral standards—helps us determine what is truly beneficial for humans in the long run. As we keep advancing technologies with hitherto unknown capabilities and access, the demand for philosophical precision and ethical acumen only increases. My reading of these works has strengthened my belief that part of being a responsible computer scientist is being a philosopher and ethicist too. As Jose rightly concludes, "ethics becomes inevitable as by nature human being is a 'social' being, a being living in relation with other fellow beings and with the nature surrounding." With more and more individuals connected in increasingly complex networks globally, and each connected with high-speed access to information at fingertips, this social aspect of the human condition presents itself insistently to each human being and significantly to all persons responsible for mapping out systems influencing our common destiny.
