# GED107 - Critical Reflection Paper 1

## Introduction

In an age where artificial intelligence generates artwork, writes essays, and increasingly makes decisions that affect human lives, the ancient disciplines of philosophy and ethics have found renewed urgency. As Bahm suggests in “What is Philosophy?”, philosophical inquiry lives “on the frontier” of human knowledge, making “crude charts of the region which lies beyond.” This frontier mentality perfectly describes our current relationship with emerging technologies. The ethical questions surrounding AI use in creative fields, academia, and daily life aren't merely technical problems—they are fundamentally philosophical ones that echo Jose's observation that “ethical problems confront everybody” and “nobody can really get through life without ethics.”

As a computer science student, I find myself at the intersection of technological capability and ethical responsibility. When examining what makes certain AI applications problematic while others seem beneficial, I'm engaging with the same fundamental questions that philosophers have explored for centuries: What constitutes knowledge? What is the nature of creativity? What responsibilities do we have toward one another? Both readings demonstrate that philosophy and ethics aren't abstract academic exercises but practical frameworks for navigating complex realities.

This reflection explores why understanding philosophy matters for character development, how philosophical approaches remain essential in addressing contemporary challenges (particularly technological ones), and what it means to be ethical in a world of rapidly evolving capabilities. Philosophy and ethics provide essential frameworks not only for developing moral character and guiding personal conduct but also for ensuring that our technological advancement serves human flourishing rather than undermining it.
