1. Label the illustration
2. Enumerate the required quantities 
3. Trace the flow of the current in the illustration if needed, if needed 
4. Combine the representation of the quantities if needed.
5. Separate the representations to get the required.


- Equivalent resistance is **total resistance**.
- Currents that does not divide is **series**.
